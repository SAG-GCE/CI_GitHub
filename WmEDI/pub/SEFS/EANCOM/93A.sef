ORDCHG~70,4,This segment is used to specify additional or substitutional item identification codes such as a buyers, or sellers item number.\r\n\r\nDE 4347:  Product Id function coded has the following restricted coded functions:\r\n\r\n1 - Additional Identification - To provide an additional identity for the product identified in the LIN segment. The additional identification can consist of :\r\n\r\nA supplemental identification which provides more information complementary to the main article number provided in the LIN segment, e.g., a batch number, promotional variant number, product group number, etc.\r\n\r\nAn alternative identification which may be used instead of the main article number provided in the LIN segment,  e.g., a buyers or sellers article number, an HIBC code, etc.\r\n\r\n4 - Substituted for - To provide the article number of a product which has been substituted by the product identified by the article number provided in the LIN segment.\r\n\r\nIn the Purchase Order Change Request this function code may be used to inform trading partners of the article number of the product originally ordered which has been substituted by another product identified in the LIN\r\nsegment. In this case, the LIN segment will refer to the substitute product and the PIA segment will provide the article number of the product in the original Purchase Order.\r\n\r\n5 - Product Identification - To provide an additional product identification which is of equal importance or significance to the code provided in the LIN segment.\r\n\r\n9 - No Substitution Accepted - The buyer will not accept any other product code than the one specified in the LIN segment. The code specified in the LIN segment is repeated in the PIA segment to confirm the only code acceptable.\r\n\r\nExamples :\r\n\r\nPIA+1+ABC1234:BP'\r\n\r\nIn this example the PIA segment is used to provide an additional identification to the article number provided in the LIN segment.

Standard texts should be mutually defined among trading partners and can be used to cover legal and other requirements.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nFTX+ZZZ+1+008::92'\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nDE C107: This composite is only used when trading partners have agreed to use mutually defined code values.\r\n\r\nDE C108: This composite is only used if coded text cannot be used.\r\n\r\nDE 3453: The language code is only used to indicate the free text language. It is only used if composite C108 is used.
ORDCHG~88,4,The PRI segment details the price for the current product identified in the LIN segment.\r\n\r\nThe calculation price detailed in the Order Response will always be the Net Unit Price, i.e., Gross Price + Charges - Allowances.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nPRI+AAA:14.58:CT:AAE'\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nData elements 5284 and 6411 are only used to indicate that the price is for a variable quantity product.
ORDCHG~89,4,This segment is used to identify the currency of the price quoted in the previous PRI segment. This segment is only used if the currency is different to that specified in the CUX at heading level.\r\n\r\nWhen specifying Reference and Target Currencies for international trade, one occurence of CUX is all that is required. The reference currency is identified in the first occurence of composite C504, with the target currency specified in the second occurence of C504. The rate of exchange between the two is detailed in DE 5402.\r\n\r\nThe general rule for calculating the rate of exchange is as follows :\r\n\r\nReference Currency multiplied by Rate = Target Currency.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nCUX+2:GBP:9'\r\n\r\nCUX+2:GBP:9+3:BEF:4+48.50'\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nDE C504: The second occurence of this composite is only used if a target currency is being specified.\r\n\r\nDE 5402: The rate of exchange is only used if a target currency has been identified in the second occurrence of C504.
ORDCHG~93,4,This occurrence of the RFF segment is used to identify references associated with the line item. This information may override what is specified in the heading section when the same qualifier is used. This segment may also be used to allocate a unique reference number to this line item in this order change.\r\n\r\nTo access the original line from a previous order message the original reference number is indicated using data element 1154 and the line number detailed in data element 1156 should match the original value specified in data element 1082, line item number, of the LIN segment of the referenced message.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nRFF+PL:653321'\r\n\r\nThis example is referencing a price list reference number 653321.\r\n\r\nRFF+ON:51442:15'\r\n\r\nThis example references line number 15 of the buyers order number 51442.\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nDE 1156: This data element is only used to reference line numbers from previous purchase orders, purchase order changes, or purchase order responses.

ORDERS~32,4,This segment is used to specify the terms of delivery for the complete order.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nTOD+3++CIF'\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nData elements 1131 and 3055 are only used if specific terms of delivery codes, which are outside those recommended by EDIFACT, are being used.
ORDERS~33,4,This segment is used if the terms of delivery specified in the TOD segment requires the identification specifically of the place of delivery.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nLOC+1+5412345678908::9'\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nData elements 1131 and 3055 are only used when a mutually defined coding structure is being used for DE 3225.
ORDERS~69,4,The detail section of the Purchase Order is formed by a repeating group of segments, always starting with the LIN segment.\r\n\r\nEach occurrence of LIN will usually correspond to a different product being ordered.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nLIN+1++5412345111115:EN'\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nDE C212: This composite will only be used for the identification of EAN/UPC codes. If another coding structure is required, e.g. HIBC, then this composite will not be used and the code will be detailed in the PIA segment.\r\n\r\nData elements 5495 and 7083 are only used when sub-lines are required.\r\n\r\nFOR A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION ON THE USAGE OF SUB-LINES PLEASE REFER TO PART I, SECTION 4.11 .
ORDERS~70,4,This segment is used to specify additional or substitutional item identification codes such as a buyers, or sellers item number.\r\n\r\nDE 4347: Product Id function coded has the following restricted coded functions:\r\n\r\n1 - Additional Identification - To provide an additional identity for the product identified in the LIN segment. The additional identification can consist of :\r\n\r\nA supplemental identification which provides more information complementary to the main article number provided in the LIN segment, e.g., a batch number, promotional variant number, product group number, etc.\r\n\r\nAn alternative identification which may be used instead of the main article number provided in the LIN segment, e.g., a buyers article number, an HIBC code, etc.\r\n\r\n2 - Identification for substitution - To provide the article number of a product which can substitute the product identified by the article number provided in the LIN segment when the latter is temporarily unavailable, e.g., a similar or identical product  coded with a different EAN number (article coded in a different country), a different size unit of the same product, a similar product with for example a different brand name.\r\n\r\n5 - Product Identification - To provide an additional product identification which is of equal importance or significance to the code provided in the LIN segment.\r\n\r\n9 - No substitution accepted - The buyer will not accept any other product code than the one specified in the LIN segment. The code specified in the LIN segment is repeated in the PIA segment to confirm the only code acceptable.\r\n\r\nExamples :\r\n\r\nPIA+1+ABC1234:BP'\r\n\r\nIn this example the PIA segment is used to provide an additional identification to the article number provided in the LIN segment. The EAN article number 5412345111115 provided in the LIN segment refers to the internal buyers part number ABC1234.\r\n\r\nPIA+2+4000862141664:EN'\r\n\r\nIn this example the PIA segment is used to provide an article number identification for substitution. The product identified in the LIN segment by the EAN article number 5412345111115 can be substituted by the product identified in the PIA segment by the EAN article number 4000862141664 in case the former is not available.\r\n\r\nPIA+5+5410738251028:EN'\r\n\r\nThis example details the EAN article number 5410738251028 which is of equal importance or significance to the EAN article number 5412345111115 identified in the LIN segment.\r\n\r\nPIA+9+5412345111115:EN'\r\n\r\nThis example details the situation where the buyer explicitly specifies that no other product is acceptable but the one specified in the LIN segment. The PIA re-specifies the product code from the LIN segment.
ORDERS~71,4,This segment is used to describe the current line item.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that this segment only be used for coded descriptions. Data element 7008 in clear text should only be used when no product code is available or when free-form descriptions are required by trading partners.\r\n\r\nIf both free-form and coded descriptions are required then the IMD segment must be repeated.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nIMD+C++TU'\r\n\r\nIMD+F++:::CORN CRISPIES:CASE'
ORDERS~72,4,This segment is used to specify the actual physical dimensions of the product being ordered where that product is sold in variable lengths or volumes.\r\n\r\nThis segment must be used in conjunction with the LIN segment for the precise identification of the ordered product.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nMEA+PD+LN:4+MTR:4.5'\r\n\r\nThe precise length of the product identified by the EAN article number 5412345111115 is 4.5 metres.
ORDERS~73,4,This segment is used to specify the total quantity ordered for the current line identified in the LIN segment.\r\n\r\nIf split deliveries are being used, the quantities for the split delivery are specified in segment group 32.

ORDERS~80,4,This segment is used to specify quantity variances.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nQVA+-20:21'\r\n\r\nNote :\r\n\r\nIt is not expected that this segment will be used in normal ordering circumstances.
ORDERS~83,4,This segment is used to specify any special requirements for the current line item.\r\n\r\nUse of this segment in free form is not recommended since it may inhibit automatic processing of the Order. Coded references to standard texts is an available functionality which enables automatic processing and reduces transmission and processing overheads. Standard texts should be mutually defined among trading partners and can be used to cover legal and other requirements.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nFTX+ZZZ+1+001::92'\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nDE C107: This composite is only used when trading partners have agreed to use mutually defined code values.\r\n\r\nDE C108: This composite is only used if coded text cannot be used.\r\n\r\nDE 3453: The language code is only used to indicate the free text language. It is only used if composite C108 is used.
ORDERS~88,4,This segment details the order price for the current line item.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nPRI+AAA:14.58:CT:AAE'\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nData elements 5284 and 6411 are only used to indicate that the price is for a variable quantity product.
ORDERS~89,4,This segment is used to specify the currencies the price detailed in the previous PRI segment.\r\n\r\nWhen specifying Reference and Target Currencies for international trade, one occurrence of CUX is all that is required. The reference currency is identified in the first occurrence of composite C504, with the target currency specified in the second occurrence of C504. The rate of exchange between the two is detailed in DE 5402.\r\n\r\nThe general rule for calculating the rate of exchange is as follows:\r\n\r\nReference Currency multiplied by Rate = Target Currency.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nCUX+2:GBP:9'\r\n\r\nCUX+2:GBP:9+3:BEF:4+48.50'\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nDE C504: the second occurrence of this composite is only used if a target currency is being specified.\r\n\r\nDE 5402: The rate of exchange is only used if a target currency has been identified in the second occurrence of C504.
ORDERS~93,4,This occurrence of the RFF segment is used to identify references associated with the line item.

PRICAT~80,4,This segment is used to specify details relating to the pricing of a product. Within the main PGI segment group the PIT segment acts as the trigger segment in the identification of a product.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\nPIT+1+3'\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nDE 1229: This data element is used to explicitly indicate the function of the current line item. The value specified here will override, for the current line item only,  any value specified in data element 1225 of the BGM segment.  Where this data element is not used the line item adopts the functionality assigned for the full message.\r\n\r\nData elements 5495 and 7083 are only used when sub-lines are required.\r\n\r\nFOR A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION ON THE USAGE OF SUB-LINES PLEASE REFER TO PART I, SECTION 4.11 .
PRICAT~81,4,This segment is used to identify the primary article number for the current line item and any other supplementary article numbers or product codes required.\r\n\r\nA minimum of one occurrence of the PIA segment containing the applicable article number and qualifiers is required for identification of the primary article number.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nPIA+5+5410738251028:EN'\r\n\r\nUse of EAN-8, UPC-A, EAN-13, and DUN-14 codes are recommended for article numbering.\r\n\r\nDE 4347: Product Id function, coded has the following restricted coded functions:\r\n\r\n1 - Additional Identification - To provide an additional identity for the primary article number identified in the 'Product Identification' PIA segment. The additional code can consist of:\r\n\r\nA supplemental identification which provides more information complementary to the main article number provided\r\nin the PIA segment, e.g., a batch number, promotional variant number, grouping code, etc.\r\n\r\nAn alternative identification which may be used instead of the main article number provided in the PIA segment, e.g., a buyers article number, an HIBC code, etc.\r\n\r\n2 - Identification for Substitution - To provide the article number of a product which can substitute the product identified by the article number provided in the 'Product Identification' PIA segment when the latter is temporarily unavailable, e.g., a similar or identical product coded with a different EAN number (article coded in a different country), a different size unit of the same product, a similar product with for example a different brand name.\r\n\r\n3 - Substituted by - To provide the article number of a product which has substituted the product identified by the article number in the 'Product Identification' PIA segment.\r\n\r\nIn the Price/Sales Catalogue this function code may be used to inform trading partners of an article number change relevant to a product. In this case, the 'Product Identification' PIA segment will contain the old article number and  the 'Substituted By' PIA segment, the new article number.\r\n\r\n4 - Substituted for - To provide the article number of a product which has been substituted by the product identified by the article number provided in the 'Product Identification' PIA segment.\r\n\r\nIn the Price/Sales Catalogue this function code may be used to inform trading partners of an article number change relevant to a product. In this case, the 'Product Identification' PIA segment will contain the new article number and the 'Substituted For' PIA segment will identify the old article number which has been substituted.\r\n\r\n5 - Product Identification - To provide the primary product article number. This functionality was previously carried out in PIT in EANCOM 90.1. Now however this is not possible using EDIFACT 92.1 and  the function must be carried out in the PIA segment u sing the above qualifier.\r\n\r\nExamples :\r\n\r\nPIA+1+AX87655:BP'\r\n\r\nIn this example the PIA segment is used to provide an additional identification to the article number provided in the 'Product Identification' PIA segment. This EAN article number 5410738251028 refers to the buyers internal part number AX87655.\r\n\r\nPIA+2+5412345111184:EN'\r\n\r\nIn this example the 'Identification for Substitution' PIA segment is used to provide an article number identification for substitution. The product identified in the 'Product Identification' PIA segment by the EAN code 5410738251028 can be substituted by the product identified in the current PIA segment by the EAN article number 5412345111184 in case the former is not available.\r\n\r\nPIA+3+5412345111184:EN'\r\n\r\nIn this example the 'Substituted By' PIA segment is used to identify an article number which is replacing the current primary article number. The current article number is identified in the 'Product Identification' PIA segment.\r\n\r\nPIA+4+5410738251028:EN'\r\n\r\nIn this example the 'Substituted For' PIA segment is used to provide the article number of the product which is being substituted for the former primary product article number. The new code 5412345111184 would be included in the message in the 'Product Id identification' PIA segment.\r\n\r\nPIA+5+5410738251028:EN'\r\n\r\nIn this example the PIA segment is used to identify the primary product article number. This is the code which is most often used in general trade.
PRICAT~82,4,Product description information is required in the price catalogue message when a product is new or its description has been amended, otherwise its use is not recommended. If both coded and free-form descriptions are required then the IMD segment must be repeated.\r\n\r\nDE 7077: This DE qualifies the type of description as: free-form, free form long, free form short or free form PLU. The actual text descriptions are provided in one or more occurrences of DE 7008. If more than one description type is needed, the IMD segment is repeated.\r\n\r\nDE 7081: If coded colour descriptions are provided the actual colour code is in DE 7009 followed by the relevant code list responsible agency.\r\n\r\nDE 7008: In those countries or regions requiring article descriptions in multiple languages, national guidelines should establish recommendations as to the order of languages.\r\n\r\nIf more than one description format needs to be provided, e.g., free-form short and free form PLU text, it is recommended that all description formats in one language be provided before commencing descriptions in another language.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nIMD+C++TU'\r\n\r\nIMD+F++:::CORN CRISPIES:CASE'
