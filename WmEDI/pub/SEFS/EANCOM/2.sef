ORDCHG~97,4,Segment Notes.\r\n\r\nThis segment is used to identify the item being ordered.\r\n\r\nThe detail section of the Purchase Order Change Request is formed by a repeating group of segments, always starting with the LIN segment.\r\n\r\nDE 1229: Action Request, coded, is the critical DE in this segment. The following code value definitions apply:\r\n\r\n1 = Addition : The buyer indicates the line item is to be added to the Purchase Order as a new or additional item. All required data must be transmitted.\r\n\r\n2  = Deleted : The buyer indicates the line item is to be deleted from the referenced Purchase Order.  No other data for the line item needs to be transmitted.\r\n\r\n3  = Changed : The buyer indicates that the line item is to be changed. The data transmitted in the LIN segment,and segments below LIN, replaces the previously held information for the order line.\r\n\r\n11 = Not Amended : The buyer indicates that the line has not being changed and is being sent for information \r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nLIN+1+2+5412345111115:EN'\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nDE C212: This composite will only be used for the identification of EAN/UPC codes. If another coding structure isbeing used, e.g. HIBC, this composite will not be used and the code will be detailed in the PIA segment.\r\n\r\nDE's C829 and 7083: These data elements are only used when sub-lines are required.\r\n\r\nFOR A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION ON THE USAGE OF SUB-LINES PLEASE REFER TO PART I, SECTION 4.11 .

ORDCHG~98,4,Segment Notes.\r\n\r\nThis segment is used to specify additional or substitutional item identification codes such as a buyers, or sellers item number.\r\n\r\nDE 4347: Product Id function coded has the following restricted coded functions:\r\n\r\n1 - Additional Identification - To provide an additional identity for the product identified in the LIN segment. The additional identification can consist of :\r\n\r\nA supplemental identification which provides more information complementary to the main article number provided in the LIN segment, e.g., a batch number, promotional variant number, product group number, etc.\r\n\r\nAn alternative identification which may be used instead of the main article number provided in the LIN segment, e.g., a buyers or sellers article number, an HIBC code, etc.\r\n\r\n4 - Substituted for - To provide the article number of a product which has been substituted for the product identified by the article number provided in the LIN segment.\r\n\r\nIn the Purchase Order Change Request this function code may be used to inform trading partners of the article number of the product originally ordered which has been substituted for another product identified in the LINsegment.\r\n\r\n5 - Product Identification - To provide an additional product identification which is of equal importance or significance to the code provided in the LIN segment.\r\n\r\n9 - No Substitution Accepted - The buyer will not accept any other product code than the one specified in the LIN segment. The code specified in the LIN segment is repeated in the PIA segment to confirm the only code acceptable.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nPIA+1+ABC1234:IN'\r\n\r\nIn this example the PIA segment is used to provide an additional identification to the article number provided in the LIN segment. The EAN article number 5412345111115 provided in the LIN segment refers to the internal buyer's item number.\r\n\r\n PIA+4+5412345111184:EN'\r\n\r\nIn this example the PIA segment is used to provide an article number of the product which has been substituted by the new (substitute) product being ordered, identified in the LIN segment by the EAN article number5412345111115.\r\n\r\nPIA+5+5410738000169:EN'\r\n\r\nIn this example the EAN article number 5410738000169 is provided as an article number of equal importance to the EAN article number 5412345111115 provided in the LIN segment.\r\n\r\nPIA+9+4000862141404:EN'\r\n\r\nThis example details the situation where the buyer explicitly specifies that no other product Id is acceptable but the one specified in the LIN segment. The PIA re-specifies the product code from the LIN segment
ORDCHG~99,4,Segment Notes.\r\n\r\nThis segment is used to describe the current line item.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that this segment only be used for coded descriptions. Data element 7008 in clear text should only be used when no product code is available or when free-form descriptions are required by trading partners.\r\n\r\nIf both free-form and text descriptions are required then the IMD segment must be repeated.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nIMD+C++TU'\r\n\r\nIMD+F++:::CORN CRISPIES:CASE'
ORDERS~1,4,This segment is used to head, identify and specify a message.\r\n\r\nDE's 0065, 0052, 0054, and 0051: Indicate that the message is an UNSM Purchase Order based on the D.96Adirectory under the control of the United Nations.\r\n\r\nDE 0057: Indicates that the message is the EANCOM version 008 of the UNSM Purchase Order.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nUNH+ME000001+ORDERS:D:96A:UN:EAN008'
ORDERS~10,4,This segment is used to specify dates relating to the references given in the preceding RFF segment.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nDTM+171:19930825:102'
ORDERS~101,4,This DTM segment is used to specify the dates (and possibly times) associated with the delivery or collection of the current referenced product.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nDTM+2:19930910:102'\r\n\r\nThis example requests delivery on the 10th of September 1993.

ORDERS~105~1~1,0,Specify the actual variance amount here.
ORDERS~108,4,This segment is used to specify any special requirements for the current line item.\r\n\r\nUse of this segment in free form is not recommended since it may inhibit automatic processing of the Order. Coded references to standard texts is an available functionality which enables automatic processing and reduces transmission and processing overheads. Standard texts should be mutually defined among trading partners and can be used to cover legal and other requirements.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nFTX+ZZZ+1+001::92'\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nDE C107: This composite is only used when trading partners have agreed to use mutually defined code values.\r\n\r\nDE C108: This composite is only used if coded text cannot be used.\r\n\r\nDE 3453: The language code is only used to indicate the free text language.

ORDERS~12,4,The NAD segment is used to identify the trading partners involved in the Order process. Identification of the buyer and supplier of goods and services is mandatory in the Order using DE's 3035 and C082. Additionally, the invoicee and delivery party need t o be specified if different than the buyers address.\r\n\r\nThe delivery address given in NAD at header level is the main delivery address for all line items. It can however be overridden at line level by the use of Segment Group 32 LOC/QTY/DTM to indicate split deliveries.\r\n\r\nIf coded address information can not be used it is recommended to use a structured address (C080 through 3207).\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nNAD+BY+5412345000010::9'\r\nNAD+SU+4012345500000::9'\r\nNAD+DP+5412345000010::9'\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nThe following composites and data elements are only used when a coded name and address can not be used or there is a requirement to furnish the full name and address for the trading party. The affected composites and data elements are as follows:\r\n\r\n   C080   -   C059   -   3164   -   3229   -   3251   -   3207
ORDERS~120,4,This segment is used to specify the currencies the price detailed in the previous PRI segment.\r\n\r\nWhen specifying Reference and Target Currencies for international trade, one occurrence of CUX is all that is required. The reference currency is identified in the first occurrence of composite C504, with the target currency specified in the second occurrence of C504. The rate of exchange between the two is detailed in DE 5402.\r\n\r\nThe general rule for calculating the rate of exchange is as follows:\r\n\r\nReference Currency multiplied by Rate = Target Currency.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nCUX+2:GBP:9'\r\n\r\nCUX+2:GBP:9+3:BEF:4+48.50'\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nDE C504: the second occurrence of this composite is only used if a target currency is being specified.\r\n\r\nDE 5402: The rate of exchange is only used if a target currency has been identified in the second occurrence of C504.

The detail section of the Purchase Order Response is formed by a repeating group of segments, always starting with the LIN segment.\r\n\r\nDE 1229: Action Request, coded, is the critical DE in this segment. The following code value definitions apply:\r\n\r\n1 = Addition : The supplier wishes to add a line to the buyer's purchase order. This may happen if the supplier can not accommodate the complete buyer's purchase order for a line in one delivery, and, suggests splitting the order line into two separate deliveries. When this is done each order response line must refer to the same order number and line number.\r\n\r\n3 = Changed : The supplier accepts to supply the line item in a purchase order or purchase order change request, but requires one or more changes to the terms set out in the referenced message, as indicated by the data in, and following, the LIN segment. The buyer must acknowledge these requirements by sending a new purchase order or purchase order change request.\r\n\r\n4 = No Action : The supplier has not yet processed the referenced line item from a purchase order or purchase order change request.\r\n\r\n5 = Accepted : The supplier accepts to supply the line item in a purchase order or purchase order change request. Though it is not necessary to re-transmit unamended line items or cancellations, this may be done for confirmation.\r\n\r\n7 = Not Accepted : The supplier declines to supply the line item in a purchase order or purchase order changerequest.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\n\r\nLIN+1+3+5412345111115:EN'\r\n\r\nDependency Notes :\r\n\r\nDE C212: This composite will only be used for the identification of EAN/UPC codes.

The additional identification can consist of:\r\n\r\nA supplemental identification which provides more information complementary to the main article number provided in the LIN segment, e.g., a batch number, promotional variant number, product group number, etc,.\r\n\r\nAn alternative identification which may be used instead of the main article number provided in the LIN segment, e.g., a buyers article number, an HIBC code, etc,.\r\n\r\n2 = Identification for potential substitution - To provide the article number of a product which can substitute the product identified by the article number provided in the LIN segment when the latter is temporarily unavailable, e.g., a similar or identical product coded with a different EAN number (article coded in a different country), a different size unit of the same product, a similar product with for example a different brand name.\r\n\r\n5 - Product Identification - To provide an identification for the product identified in the LIN segment which is of equal importance.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\nPIA+1+AB7456:IN'\r\n\r\nIn this example the PIA segment is used to provide an additional identification to the article number provided in the LIN segment. The EAN article number 5412345111115 provided in the LIN segment refers to the internal buyer's item number AB7456.\r\n\r\nPIA+2+4000862141662:EN'\r\n\r\nIn this example the PIA segment is used to provide an article number identification for substitution. The product identified in the LIN segment by the EAN article number 5412345111115 can be substituted by the product identified in the PIA segment by the EAN article number 4000862141662 in case the former is not available.\r\n\r\nPIA+5+5412345123453:EN'\r\n\r\nIn this example the EAN article number identified in the PIA segment identifies the fact that this code is of equal importance to the code 5412345111115 identified in LIN. The prices quoted in this line relate to both codes and the order may be made using either code.
