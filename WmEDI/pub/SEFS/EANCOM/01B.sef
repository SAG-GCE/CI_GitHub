INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Application error and acknowledgement message (APERAK) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nThe function of this message is:\r\na)  to inform a message issuer that his message has been received by the addressee's application and has been rejected due to errors encountered during its processing in the application.\r\nb)  to acknowledge to a message issuer the receipt of his message by the addressee's application.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Application error and acknowledgement message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nA message being first controlled at system level (CONTRL) to detect syntax errors and to acknowledge its receipt is then transmitted to the application process to be processed.\r\n\r\nIf an error is detected at the application level, which prevents its complete processing, an APERAK message is sent to the original message issuer giving details of the error(s) encountered.\r\nIf no error has been detected and when an acknowledgement is necessary (when no dedicated answer to the original message exists) an APERAK message is sent precising the reasons of acknowledgement.\r\nIn case of application error, the APERAK message will need manual processing e.g. when the underlying reason is a programming error.\r\n\r\nIn case of acknowledgement the APERAK message may be automatically or manually processed at recipient's discretion.\r\n\r\n2.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Contractual conditions message (CNTCND) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message sent by a customer to a supplier and other interested parties providing the contractual conditions of a previously negotiated contract in order to enable the automatic processing of invoices for orders which have been made against the contract or for the completion of identified stages within the contract.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Contractual conditions message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nA Contractual conditions message is sent by a customer to a supplier and other interested parties in order to inform them of the contractual conditions which will be used in the validation of orders and in the verification of invoices prior to payment.\r\nThis message is typically used in the case where a general contract has been established between the customer and the supplier against which goods will be ordered over a period of time on an order by order basis. The contract will have been previously negotiated and accepted. This message only contains the information that can be used in automatically approving the issuance of an order or the correctness of an invoice. It is not intended to contain the totality of the contractual information.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Commercial account summary message (COACSU) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA commercial account summary message enables the transmission of commercial data concerning payments made and outstanding items on an account over a period of time. The message may be sent at specific agreed fixed intervals or on demand, and may be sent to and, or, from trading parties and, or, their authorised agents.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Commercial account summary message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nA commercial account summary may:\r\n- refer to invoices, credit notes, debit notes, or payments over a period of time.\r\n- refer to only one account, in one currency.\r\n- be initiated at any time by a party, depending upon agreement between the parties involved.\r\n- provide information on an account over a period of time. When the message is used in this way both payments made and amounts outstanding may be detailed.\r\n- may contain additional information for customs and/or statistical purposes/services.\r\n- be used as a reminder of payment due for the current accounting period.\r\n- be used as a request for payment of outstanding invoices and detail penalties for amounts outstanding from previous accounting periods.\r\n- be used in the reconciliation of accounts when detailing payments made.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding an implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nWhere a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\n\r\nConditional data that is not required in the message should not be included.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.\r\n\r\nFree text information within the message should be avoided as this inhibits automatic processing. It is only used when additional information that cannot be accommodated within the other segments is required.

SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA notice of commercial dispute against one or more invoices is usually raised by the buyer to notify the seller that something was found wrong with the goods delivered or the services rendered (goods damaged, delivery incomplete, delivery late, etc.). The dispute must be resolved before the related invoice can be settled.\r\n\r\nThe message will be used to: - notify a dispute; - correspond about an existing dispute (structured information); - notify the settlement of a dispute.\r\n\r\nThe message will serve at the same time as the dispute notice and as the dispute answer.\r\n\r\nThroughout this document, the term 'Buyer' refers to either the buyer or an Agent acting on behalf of the Buyer, and the term 'Seller' refers either to the seller or an Agent acting on behalf of the Seller.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Commercial dispute message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThe usual flow of communication is from buyer to seller: the buyer sends a dispute notice to the seller, and the seller sends back a dispute answer to the buyer. Optionally, the seller may also send a credit note. An alternative flow of communication is from seller to buyer, e.g. if the seller disputes the payment of a related invoice.\r\n\r\nIf part of the invoice is disputed, then as a consequence the whole invoice will be disputed.\r\n\r\n- One dispute may relate to one or more invoices/credit notes;\r\n- One dispute may relate to one or more payments;\r\n- One dispute must relate to one seller;\r\n- One dispute must relate to one buyer.\r\n\r\n2.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Drawing administration message (CONDRA) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nThe message will be used for the administration of each exchange of a set of engineering/CAD files. It will give additional information about the files; for example, their nature, a list of their contents and technical information necessary to interpret them.\r\n\r\nThe whole process of exchanging engineering or CAD (Computer Aided Design) files between different parties within projects will be supported by EDIFACT messages. The message CONDRA is one of these messages.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Drawing administration message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\nThe following descriptions refer to the exchange of engineering/CAD files, but do not exclude any other type of "native" files, e.g. files originating from software packages and tools like word-processing, spreadsheet, DTP (Desk Top Publishing), graphics and so on.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nCONDRA is the EDIFACT message to administer the exchange of engineering/CAD files. The message itself does not consist of any engineering or graphical information. This information will be transferred within files written in existing standard graphical exchange formats or native formats, referred to within the message as external file reference to identify each of these files. The nature of the engineering files and its content is not relevant for the syntax of the EDIFACT message.\r\n\r\nAll types of engineering/CAD files may be exchanged during a project's life cycle.

CONTRL,2,Date:\r\n97-03-17\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nSyntax Development Group (SDG)\r\n\r\n0. INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Syntax and service report message (CONTRL) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nCONTRL is a message syntactically acknowledging or rejecting, with error indication, a received interchange, functional group or message.\r\n\r\nA CONTRL message can be used to:\r\n\r\na)  acknowledge or reject a received interchange, functional group or message and list any errors contained therein, or\r\n\r\nb)  indicate only the receipt of an interchange.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Syntax and service report message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\nThis specification of CONTRL can be used for version 1, 2, or 3 of the EDIFACT syntax (ISO 9735).\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThis specification of CONTRL can be used for version 1, 2, or 3 of the EDIFACT syntax (ISO 9735).\r\n\r\nThe sender (A) of an EDIFACT interchange can in segment UNB request a response from the recipient (B) that the interchange has been received, is syntactically correct, that the service segments are semantically correct and that the recipient supports those functions requested in the service segments. Alternatively, the request can be specified in an Interchange Agreement (IA) between the interchanging partners.\r\n\r\nThe interchange sent from A to B is called the subject interchange.\r\n\r\nThe response is sent from the recipient (B) of the subject interchange to the sender of the subject interchange (A) as one or two CONTRL messages.\r\n\r\nA CONTRL message indicates\r\n- the action taken by the recipient as the result of a syntactical check of the subject interchange, or alternatively\r\n- only receipt of the interchange.\r\n\r\nIn the first case, the action (acknowledgement or rejection, see section 3) indicates the result of a syntactical check of the complete received interchange.  The action may be indicated for the complete interchange, or it may be indicated for individual parts of it. Thus, some messages or functional groups may be acknowledged and others may be rejected. The CONTRL message must indicate the action for all parts of the subject interchange.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, only receipt of the subject interchange is indicated, see clause 3.\r\n\r\nDuring a syntactical check, the interchange, or part of it, is checked for compliance with:\r\n- EDIFACT syntax rules (ISO 9735),including rules for use of service segments,\r\n- the syntactical aspects in specifications for the message type(s) received, and\r\n- any additional agreements between partners regarding use of the syntax rules. Such agreements shall be conformant with ISO 9735.\r\n\r\nCONTRL shall not be used to report errors, or the action taken, at the application level, i.e. reports related to the semantic information contained in user segments.  Thus, acknowledgement indicated by means of CONTRL does not imply that the business content of a message has been accepted or can be complied with.\r\n\r\nA recipient may choose to acknowledge an interchange, or part of it, even if it contains syntactical errors. These errors may also be reported. The definition of a non-fatal error is determined by the recipient. The recipient may for example, choose to acknowledge a data element exceeding the specified maximum length.\r\n\r\nCONTRL messages may be generated by the recipient of the subject interchange or by a third party acting on behalf of the recipient.  In this case, the UNB of the interchange containing  the CONTRL messages will contain the same sender and receiver identifications as the subject interchange, only reversed. Alternatively, one CONTRL message rejecting the complete interchange may be generated by a third party, for example a network service, to indicate non-delivery. In this case, the UNB of the CONTRL message will contain a sender identification of the third party.\r\n\r\nPartners may agree that a CONTRL message rejecting an erroneous subject interchange, or part of it, shall always be sent even if acknowledgement has not been requested in the subject interchange UNB segment.\r\n\r\nA CONTRL message shall only be generated if the originator of the subject interchange supports the receipt of the CONTRL message. Support for receipt of CONTRL messages is indicated either by the acknowledgement request in the subject interchange UNB segment or in an IA.\r\n\r\nA CONTRL message shall never be sent in a functional group.\r\n\r\nNote: A CONTRL message rejecting the subject interchange may be sent if the actual recipient is different from the one identified in the subject interchange UNB segment.  The CONTRL message shall be sent to the originator of the subject interchange, unless there is an agreement with a third party to send it to the third party. The CONTRL message shall not be sent unless the originator of the subject interchange is known to accept CONTRL messages from the originator of the CONTRL message. In some cases it may be necessary to generate the CONTRL manually, or notify the subject interchange originator by other means than CONTRL. Notification by other means than CONTRL would be necessary, for example, if the subject interchange contained only CONTRL messages (see 1.3.7).\r\n\r\n1.3.1 Relations between CONTRL and the subject interchange\r\n\r\nA maximum of two CONTRL messages may be sent in response to a received interchange.  The first, which is optional, indicates only the receipt of the subject interchange. The second reports the action taken after the syntax check of the subject interchange. The action code in the UCI segment will indicate if the message is of the first or second type, see 5.5.\r\n\r\nIf a request for acknowledgement is indicated in the subject interchange UNB, then the second type of CONTRL message must be sent to report the results of a syntax check of the subject interchange. The optionality of the first message implies that, if any CONTRL message is sent at all, the second type of CONTRL message must always be sent, while the first type is sent at the discretion of the subject interchange receiver. The first type may only be sent if agreed in an IA. The UCI segment in CONTRL messages of the first type shall not be used to report any errors, i.e. only a message of the second type shall be sent when there is a need to report errors by means of the UCI segment.\r\n\r\nA CONTRL message can only report the action taken for one subject interchange, i.e.  it may not refer to several subject interchanges, or to parts of several subject interchanges.\r\n\r\nThe structure of CONTRL is based on five segments (UCI, UCF, UCM, UCS and UCD), each containing a reference to a part of the subject interchange. The parts of the subject interchange are: - the UNA, UNB and UNZ segments, referenced in the UCI segment - the UNG and UNE segments, referenced in the UCF segment\r\n- a complete message, referenced in the UCM segment\r\n- a segment in a message, referenced in the UCS segment\r\n- a simple, composite or component data element, referenced in the UCD segment.\r\n\r\nThese parts of the subject interchange are called referenced-levels.\r\n\r\nEach of the five mentioned segments in CONTRL contains a data element indicating the action taken for the referenced part, and optionally data elements used for error reporting. Each of the five segments is called a reporting-level.\r\n\r\nSegment groups 1 and 3 shall not be used in a CONTRL message acknowledging only the receipt of an interchange. If the subject interchange contains functional groups, only segment group 3 is used in the CONTRL message. If functional groups are not used, only segment group 1 is used in the CONTRL message.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a need to send a UCM-group (segment group 1 or 4), no more than one UCM-group shall be sent per received message.\r\n\r\nAll reporting-levels shall be in the same order as their corresponding referenced-levels in the subject interchange.\r\n\r\n1.3.2 Action codes usage\r\n\r\nThe referenced-levels of the subject interchange that may be acknowledged or rejected are those referenced by the UCI, UCF and UCM segments, i.e.\r\n- the UNA, UNB and UNZ segments\r\n- the UNG and UNE segments\r\n- a complete message.\r\n\r\nThe CONTRL message also provides the means to acknowledge or reject a complete interchange or a complete functional group, without referencing messages or functional groups contained in it.\r\n\r\nThe action (acknowledgement or rejection) is indicated by a code in the UCI, UCF and UCM segments, see code list 0083. This code may indicate the action for the corresponding referenced-level, and in some cases also for its lower levels (in the interchange hierarchy, cf. Figure 1 in ISO 9735).\r\n\r\nA referenced-level in the subject interchange is said to be explicitly reported if the CONTRL message contains a corresponding segment that references that level.  Explicit reporting of a lower referenced-level requires that all referenced-levels above are acknowledged.\r\n\r\nA referenced-level is said to be implicitly reported if the action taken for the level is reported by a UCI or UCF segment referencing a higher level in the subject interchange. Thus, for example, a functional group and all messages within it are implicitly rejected if the action code in the UCI segment indicate rejection of the complete subject interchange. Also, a message is implicitly acknowledged when the action code in UCI or UCF indicates acknowledgement of messages at the next lower level, and no UCM rejecting the message is present.\r\n\r\nAction codes 4 and 7 are only used in CONTRL messages reporting the action after complete check of the interchange. Action code 8 is only used in CONTRL messages indicating the receipt of an interchange.\r\n\r\n1.3.3 Reporting of syntactical errors\r\n\r\nErrors can be reported at all reporting-levels of CONTRL by means of data elements in the segment constituting the reporting-level. These data elements identify the error's position in the subject interchange and indicate its nature.\r\n\r\nThe UCI, UCF and UCM segments can only report one error. If more than one error is detected at a level referenced by one of these segments, the receiver of the subject interchange is free to choose which error to report. Several CONTRL messages shall not be sent in order to report several errors.\r\n\r\nErrors may be reported even if the referenced-level (including erroneous parts) is acknowledged. Users should be aware that some syntactical errors could change the semantics of data, and that the receiver of the subject interchange is responsible for any consequences when data with syntactic errors are acknowledged.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that errors are identified as precisely as possible. If a precise error code can be defined, a more general (and imprecise) error code shall not be used. Similarly, the position of the error shall be identified as precisely as possible by using the lowest possible reporting-level.\r\n\r\nNo "copying" of error codes from a lower to a higher reporting-level shall occur.  It would otherwise, for example, be possible to report a data element error by an error code in UCD, and repeat the same error code in UCM. In this case, the error code identifying the error shall only appear in UCD. The same rule applies at all reporting-levels.\r\n\r\nIdentification of an error's exact position and nature on receipt of the CONTRL message will often require access to the subject interchange in the format it was transferred.\r\n\r\n1.3.4 Errors in data elements that are copied from the subject interchange to the CONTRL message\r\n\r\nThe CONTRL message contains several mandatory data elements that are copied from the subject interchange. If the data element in the subject interchange is missing or is syntactically invalid, a syntactically valid CONTRL message can not be generated. The error must then be reported by other means than CONTRL, unless all parties processing the CONTRL message has agreed in an IA that copying of erroneous data elements into the CONTRL message is permitted. The omission of mandatory data elements may also be permitted by an IA.\r\n\r\n1.3.5 Redundant reporting of action\r\n\r\nIf action code 7 is used in UCI, it is not an error if UCM or UCF segments are sent acknowledging a message or functional group. Similarly, redundant UCM segments may acknowledge messages in a functional group when the code is used in UCF.\r\n\r\n1.3.6 Re-transmission\r\n\r\nThe conditions which determine the requirements to re-send an interchange, functional group or a message must be agreed between the interchanging partners outside the scope of CONTRL.\r\n\r\n1.3.7 Acknowledgement or rejection of CONTRL messages\r\n\r\nNo CONTRL, or other message types in UN/EDIFACT, shall be sent in response to a received CONTRL message. Errors in received CONTRL messages must be reported by other means than CONTRL.\r\n\r\nIf one or more CONTRL messages are contained in an interchange being responded to, the CONTRL messages generated as a response to that received interchange shall be generated as if no CONTRL messages were contained in the received interchange.\r\n\r\nCONTRL messages shall not be sent in response to received interchanges that contain only CONTRL messages.\r\n\r\nIf CONTRL messages are mixed with other message types in an interchange, an implicit acknowledgement or rejection received for parts of that interchange does not apply to the CONTRL messages.\r\n\r\n1.3.8 Support of the CONTRL message type\r\n\r\nRequirements for support for submission and receipt of the CONTRL message type should be agreed between partners.\r\n\r\nAll parties requesting acknowledgement by means of the Acknowledgement request data element in UNB must support receipt of the CONTRL message type.\r\n\r\nAll parties supporting receipt of the CONTRL message type shall be able to understand all information at all reporting-levels in CONTRL, and be able to identify the parts of the subject interchange that are acknowledged or rejected.  The party shall be able to receive CONTRL messages where implicit reporting is used.\r\n\r\nAll parties supporting submission of the CONTRL message type shall be able to check all parts of the interchange and generate all the reporting-levels of CONTRL.  Support for a reporting-level implies that errors are reported at the reporting-level corresponding to the referenced-level where the error occurred.\r\n\r\nSupport for generation of segment group 3 in CONTRL is not required if an IA prohibits the use of functional groups. A party supporting receipt of CONTRL must support reception of segment group 3 if he submits interchanges with functional groups.\r\n\r\n2.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Multiple credit advice message (CREMUL) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA Multiple Credit Advice message is sent by an Account Servicing Financial Institution to the Account Owner or to a third party, which has agreed bilaterally in advance, that its account (s) has been or will be credited for specified amount (s) on the date (s) indicated, in settlement of the referenced business transaction (s).\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Multiple credit advice message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\n- A CREMUL may cover the financial settlement of one or more commercial trade transactions, such as invoices, credit notes, debit notes, etc. It is not intended for use in securities trading.\r\n\r\n- Several credit accounts, value dates, entry dates and currencies may be specified.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following semantic principles apply to the message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nThe Multiple Credit Advice message is structured in three levels: A, B and C.\r\n\r\n- Level A Segment Groups 1,2,3 and 28 contains general data related to the whole message.\r\n\r\n- Level B Segment Groups 4 to 9 is based on the following rules:\r\n  Level B contains data which applies to all the dependent C levels, such as,\r\n\r\n  Same area Code:\r\nWhen the BUS segment is used, domestic and international items should not be mixed in the same sequence of B and C levels.\r\n\r\n  Same currency and same account:\r\n  The items to be grouped must refer to the same account. The currency to be booked must be the same as that of the account.\r\n\r\n  Same value date:\r\n  The items must have the same value date.\r\n\r\n  Same entry date:\r\n  The items must be booked on the same day.\r\n\r\n  Same bank operation code:\r\n  The items must bear the same bank operation code.\r\n\r\n  Remark: If, for the same receiver, one of these 5 basic pieces of information changes, a new level B is required.\r\n\r\n- Level C Segment Groups 10 to 27 contains the individual transactions, which are related to the data stored on level B.\r\n\r\n- The structure of the message is designed to allow several B and C levels, each level B being followed by one or several C levels.\r\n\r\n- Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.

DEBMUL,2,Date:\r\n2001-05-15\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nD6 Finance (SWG)\r\n\r\n0. INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Multiple debit advice message (DEBMUL) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA DEBMUL message is sent by an Account Servicing Financial Institution to the Account Owner or to a third party, which has agreed bilaterally in advance, that its account (s) has been or will be debited for specified amount (s) on the date (s) indicated, in settlement of the referenced business transaction (s).\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Multiple debit advice message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\n- A DEBMUL may cover the financial settlement of one or more commercial trade transactions, such as invoices, credit notes, debit notes, etc. It is not intended for use in securities trading.\r\n\r\n- Several debit accounts, value dates, entry dates and currencies may be specified.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following semantic principles apply to the message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nThe Multiple Debit Advice message is structured in three levels: A, B and C.\r\n\r\n- Level A Segment Groups 1,2,3 and 28 contains general data related to the whole message.\r\n\r\n- Level B Segment groups 4 to 9 is based on the following rules:\r\n  Level B contains data which applies to all the dependent C levels, such as,\r\n\r\n  Same area Code:\r\nWhen the BUS segment is used, domestic and international items should not be mixed in the same sequence of B and C levels.\r\n\r\n  Same currency and same account:\r\n  The items to be grouped must refer to the same account. The currency to be booked must be the same as that of the account.\r\n\r\n  Same value date:\r\n  The items must have the same value date.\r\n\r\n  Same entry date:\r\n  The items must be booked on the same day.\r\n\r\n  Same bank operation code:\r\n  The items must bear the same bank operation code.\r\n\r\n  Remark: If, for the same receiver, one of these 5 basic pieces of information changes, a new level B is required.\r\n\r\n- Level C Segment groups 10 to 27 contains the individual transactions, which are related to the data stored on level B.\r\n\r\n- The structure of the message is designed to allow several B and C levels, each level B being followed by one or several C levels.\r\n\r\n- Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.

DELFOR~39~1,1,Product Id function qualifier has the following restricted coded values:\r\n1 - Additional Identification - To provide an additional identity for the product identified in the LIN segment. The additional identification can consist of :\r\nA supplemental identification which provides more information complementary to the main article number provided in the LIN segment, e.g., a batch number, promotional variant number, product group number, etc.\r\nAn alternative identification which may be used instead of the main article number provided in the LIN segment, e.g., a buyers article number, an HIBC code, etc,.\r\n2 - Identification for substitution - To provide the article number of a product which can substitute the product identified by the article number provided in the LIN segment when the latter is temporarily unavailable, e.g., a similar or identical product coded with a different GTIN (article coded in a different country), a different size unit of the same product, a similar product with for example a different brand name.\r\n5 - Product Identification  - To provide the primary product identification code when no GTIN has been provided in the LIN segment.\r\nX1 - No substitution accepted - The buyer will not accept any other product code than the one specified in the LIN segment. The code specified in the LIN segment is repeated in the PIA segment to confirm the only code acceptable.
DELFOR~39,4,This segment is used to specify additional or substitutional item identification codes such as a buyer's or supplier's item number.\r\nExample:\r\nPIA+1+TC56332:IN'\r\nIn this example the PIA segment is used to provide an additional identification to the article number provided in the LIN segment. The GTIN 5412345111115 provided in the LIN segment refers to the internal buyer's part number TC56332.\r\nPIA+2+4000862141664:SRV'\r\nIn this example the PIA segment is used to provide an article number identification for substitution. The product identified in the LIN segment by the GTIN 5412345111115 can be substituted by the product identified in the PIA segment by the GTIN 4000862141664 in case the former is not available.\r\nPIA+5+2209953C001L:AC'\r\nThis example details the HIBC code 2209953C001L which is provided as the primary product code because no GTIN was provided in the LIN segment.\r\nPIA+X1+5412345111115:SRV'\r\nThis example details the situation where the buyer explicitly specifies that no other product is acceptable but the one specified in the LIN segment. The PIA re-specifies the product code from the LIN segment.
DELFOR~40~2~3,0,Must be used if DE7081 contains an EAN Code.
DELFOR~40,4,This segment is used to describe the current line item.\r\nIt is recommended that this segment only be used for coded descriptions. Data element 7008 in clear text should only be used when no product code is available or when free-form descriptions are required by trading partners.

DELFOR,2,Date:\r\n2001-05-15\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nD1 Materials Management (SWG)\r\n\r\n0. INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Delivery schedule message (DELFOR) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nWARNING! This version of the DELFOR is not upward compatible with versions prior to D96B.\r\n\r\nDELFOR is a message which is sent from a party who is planning the use or consumption of products to a party who has to plan for the supply of the products. The message gives the requirements regarding details for short term delivery and/or medium to long scheduling for products. The scheduling can be used to authorize manufacturing and or the provision of materials.\r\nThis is based on the terms and conditions defined in a purchase order or contract.\r\n\r\nThe message may also be sent in response by a party which has received a DELFOR message to indicate to the party which has issued the message, the acceptance of, rejection of, or to propose amendments to the previous message.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Delivery schedule message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\n1.3.1 DELFOR used for scheduling and forecasting.\r\n\r\nThe Delivery schedule message shall be used to:\r\n\r\n- specify firm delivery dates and the quantities scheduled (using segment SCC, data element Delivery plan status indicator, coded (4017)= "Firm".\r\n\r\n- specify forecasted production requirements (using SCC, data element Delivery plan status indicator, coded (4017)=either "commitment for manufacturing and material (2)" or "commitment for material (3)" or "planning/forecast (4)".\r\n\r\n- define the aspects that guarantee the synchronization between the supplying and receiving parties, thus allowing the supplier to plan for the resources necessary to fulfill customer requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Delivery schedule message provides the option to use one of two scheduling methods.\r\n\r\nMethod 1: delivery point driven\r\nThis is when for a given delivery point a number of different products are to be delivered. This means that address information triggers product information. Usage of segment group 7 is consequently required for the specification of delivery points.\r\n\r\nMethod 2: product driven\r\nThis is when a given product is to be delivered to a number of different delivery points. This means that product information triggers address information.\r\nConsequently, segment group 7 is not to be used. Delivery point information shall be specified in segment group 22.\r\n\r\nAn initiating Delivery schedule message is identified in the BGM with the "document name code (1001)" equal to "delivery schedule (241)" and "message function code (1225)" equal to "original (9)".\r\n\r\nA subsequent message may be used to replace the schedule completely (quantities and dates). This is identified in the BGM with the "message function code (1225)" equal to "replace (5)". The replacement of a schedule requires the new schedule to totally override the previous one.\r\n\r\nAlternatively the message may be used to partially alter the schedule. This is identified in the BGM with the "message function code (1225)" equal to "change (4)". Such alteration to the schedule shall adhere to the following recommendations:\r\n\r\n1.    All the date information in the QTY-DTM segment group shall be systematically used to identify the group to be changed.\r\n\r\n2.    How the information is to be changed:\r\n\r\n2.a. To change a quantity - where the date information matches the current quantity is replaced with the new quantity.\r\n\r\n2.b. To change a date - the current quantity has to be changed to zero and the new date information has to be given with the quantity from the former schedule.\r\n\r\n2.c. To change a date and quantity - the current quantity has to be changed to zero and the new date information has to be given with appropriate new quantity.\r\n\r\n2.d. To delete quantities and dates - the current quantity has to be changed to zero.\r\n\r\n2.e. To add quantities and dates - the new date information has to be given with the appropriate new quantity.\r\n\r\n3.    Unchanged dates and quantities - unchanged dates and quantities from the former schedule need to be resent.\r\n\r\n4.    Delivered quantities - delivered quantities are automatically eliminated from the schedule.\r\n\r\nThe association to the previous Delivery schedule message is given by referencing the appropriate document/message number.\r\n\r\n1.3.2 DELFOR used for response purposes.\r\n\r\nThe indication of a DELFOR message for response purposes is achieved through the use of 'Delivery Schedule Response' code value in data element 1001 of the BGM segment.\r\n\r\nWhen used as a response to a previous DELFOR message the message may be used to indicate one of the following conditions using code values in data element 1225 of the BGM segment:\r\n\r\n- Total acceptance;\r\n- Total rejection;\r\n- Not processed;\r\n- Proposal for change.\r\n\r\nTotal acceptance of a previous DELFOR message may be indicated using code value '29, Accepted without amendment', in data element 1225 of the BGM segment. Where a previous DELFOR message is being totally accepted then only the EDIFACT mandatory segments, and those agreed by the parties exchanging the message which enable the identification of the previous message, need be re-sent.\r\n\r\nTotal rejection of a previous DELFOR message may be indicated using code value '27, Not accepted', in data element 1225 of the BGM segment. Where a previous DELFOR message is being totally rejected then only the EDIFACT mandatory segments, and those agreed by the parties exchanging the message which enable the identification of the previous message, need be re-sent. If required the reason for rejection may be indicated in the FTX segment at header level using either a bi-laterally agreed reason code, or a free text reason.\r\n\r\nShould a DELFOR message have been received but not yet processed through the relevant internal application(s), a response may be issued indicating this fact using code value '12, Not processed', in data element 1225 of the BGM segment.\r\nWhere this code value is being used then only the EDIFACT mandatory segments, and those agreed by the parties exchanging the message which enable the identification of the previous message, need be re-sent.\r\n\r\nWhen the party responding to a previous DELFOR message wishes to propose changes to some of the information contained in the previous message, then the code value '4, Change' should be used in data element 1225 of the BGM segment.\r\n\r\nIf no information at the detail level of the message (i.e. from the GIS segment onwards) changes then only the EDIFACT mandatory segments, those agreed by the parties exchanging the message which enable the identification of the previous message, and the segments containing the data proposed for change need be re-sent.\r\n\r\nWhen changes are proposed to data contained at the detail level of the message then the following recommendations should be applied:\r\n\r\n1. All the date information in the QTY-DTM segment group shall be systematically used to identify the group to be changed.\r\n\r\n2. How the information is to be changed:\r\n\r\n2.a. To change a quantity - where the date information matches the current quantity is replaced with the new quantity.\r\n\r\n2.b. To change a date - the current quantity has to be changed to zero and the new date information has to be given with the quantity from the former schedule.\r\n\r\n2.c. To change a date and quantity - the current quantity has to be changed to zero and the new date information has to be given with appropriate new quantity.\r\n\r\n2.d. To delete quantities and dates - the current quantity has to be changed to zero.\r\n\r\n2.e. To add quantities and dates - the new date information has to be given with the appropriate new quantity.\r\n\r\n3. Unchanged dates and quantities - unchanged dates and quantities from the former schedule need to be resent.\r\n\r\n4. Delivered quantities - delivered quantities are automatically eliminated from the schedule.\r\n\r\n2.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Despatch advice message (DESADV) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\nThis paper provides the definition of the United Nations Standard Despatch Advice message to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners.\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message specifying details for goods despatched or ready for despatch under agreed conditions.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations Despatch Advice Message serves both as a specification for Delivery Despatch Advice and also as a Returns Despatch Advice message. Throughout this document, the reference to 'Despatch Advice' may be interpreted as conveying the wider meaning of 'Delivery Despatch Advice/Returns Despatch Advice'.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Despatch advice message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThe message intent is to advise of the detailed contents of a consignment.\r\n\r\nThe message relates to one seller and one buyer or their respective agents.\r\n\r\nThe message relates to a single despatch point and single or multiple destination points. It may cover a number of different items or packages.\r\n\r\nIt allows the recipient to:\r\n\r\n - know when the material has been despatched or will be ready for despatch\r\n\r\n - have the precise details of the consignment\r\n\r\n - take initial steps towards Customs clearance in the case of international consignments\r\n\r\n- enable matching between despatched goods and the following invoice.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nAll specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).\r\n\r\nWhere a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used.\r\n\r\nConditional data that is not required in the message should be omitted.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.\r\n\r\nFree text information within the message should be avoided as this inhibits automatic processing.

DIRDEB,2,Date:\r\n2001-05-15\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nD6 Finance (SWG)\r\n\r\n0. INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Direct debit message (DIRDEB) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nPrior to the Direct Debit procedure, some agreement(s) would usually have been concluded :\r\n\r\n- agreement between the Creditor and his Bank (mainly to specify the conditions of credit and the kind of direct debit).\r\n\r\n- agreement between the Debtor and the Debtor's Bank (i.e. pre- authorization and condition of debit), or between the Creditor and the Debtor.\r\n\r\nA Direct Debit is sent by the Creditor to the Creditor's Bank instructing it to claim specified amount(s) from the Debtor(s) and to credit the amount(s) to an account specified in the message, which the Creditor's Bank services for the Creditor in settlement of the referenced transaction(s).\r\n\r\nThroughout this document the term 'Creditor' refers to either a Beneficiary or a Payee, likewise the term 'Debtor' refers to either an Ordering Customer or a Payor.\r\n\r\nThe term 'Bank' may be interpreted as any financial institution.\r\n\r\nThe term 'pre-authorization' refers to an agreement between a Creditor and a Debtor for\r\n\r\n- either automatic debiting, as required,\r\n\r\n- or for debiting unless rejected by the debtor in a period of time.\r\n\r\nThe agreement can also be made between the debtor and his bank, independently of the amount of the DIRDEB.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Direct debit message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\nThis message type may be applied, for both national and international settlements, but it is based on the national existing rules of the debit side.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\n- A Direct Debit may cover the financial settlement(s) of one or more commercial trade transactions, such as invoices, credit notes, debit notes, etc. It is not intended for use in securities trading.\r\n\r\n- Several credit accounts, execution dates and currencies may be specified.\r\n\r\n- Charges may be borne on account(s) different of the account(s) held by the Creditor.\r\n\r\n- The Creditor's Bank may need a confirmation/authorization (AUTHOR) from the creditor to be able to process the Direct Debit Message.\r\n\r\n- Pre-authorized and non pre-authorized direct debits shall not be mixed within the same message.\r\n\r\n- The only way to modify a Direct Debit message is to cancel the whole message or a transaction thereof (e.g. by the use of the FINCAN message). In that respect, one to many order(s) could be cancelled within the message, avoiding to be obliged to cancel the whole message.\r\n\r\nThe cancellation of a message can only be effected by the originator of the message. The kind of cancellation is dependent upon the process of the message or a transaction of it.\r\n\r\n2.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the General purpose message (GENRAL) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message to enable the transmission of textual information.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe General purpose message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThis message:\r\n- may be used to send general application support information to one or multiple addresses.\r\n\r\n- may be used to send required data for which there is no specific standard message.\r\n\r\n- MUST not be used as a substitute for an existing UNSM under development, under trial or at approved status. Nor should it be used to avoid the development of a more specific application message.\r\n\r\n- is not designed or intended to be used as a replacement for existing electronic mail systems.\r\n\r\nThe GENRAL message was designed primarily to\r\n\r\n. facilitate early transmission testing between new EDI partners;\r\n\r\n. broadcasting of known problem areas to EDI partners;\r\n\r\n. transmission of text (preferably structured or coded) to supplement or further clarify previously transmitted EDI standard messages, e.g. to stress that provision data is for test purposes only contains known errors to test out error routines.\r\n\r\n. transmission of small amounts of structured text where no existing messages exist, e.g. computer listings.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nAll specified dates/times should be in the format 'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhere a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\n\r\nConditional data that is not required in the message should not be included.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken to ensure that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.\r\n\r\nFree text information within the message should be avoided as this inhibits automatic processing.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Cargo/goods handling and movement message (HANMOV) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message from a party to a warehouse/distribution centre identifying the handling services and where required the movement of specified goods, limited to warehouses within the jurisdiction of the distribution centre.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Cargo/goods handling and movement message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThis message addresses the indirect flow of goods between seller and buyer through a warehouse/distribution centre.\r\n\r\nThe functions of this message are limited to:\r\n\r\n- assembly/disassembly of goods and products, without interfering in the manufacturing process\r\n- (re-)packing/unpacking\r\n- control of goods associated with the handling services but not interfering in the manufacturing process\r\n- marking and labelling on the packages of the goods but does not extend to the marking and labelling of the products\r\n- movement of goods limited between warehouses within the jurisdiction of the distribution centre\r\n- preparation of goods for shipment\r\n- storage\r\n- clearance\r\n- goods inspection\r\n- hazardous material handling\r\n\r\nThe movement of specified goods relates here to the area where control of the goods is to be exercised from the arrival of the goods to the distribution centre until the departure of the goods from the distribution centre to another party.

IFCSUM,2,Date:\r\n2001-05-15\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nD4 Transport (SWG)\r\n\r\n0. INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Forwarding and consolidation summary message (IFCSUM) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message to be used for consolidation purposes from a party arranging forwarding and transport services to the party for which the transport of the consolidated cargo is destined.\r\nThe message can be used to exchange information concerning the consolidated cargo between forwarders, carriers and agents enabling those parties to handle the consignments included in this consolidation.\r\nIn addition it can be used for a collection of consignments originating from one shipper for forwarding and transport services.\r\nIn addition it can be used for an advice of insurance related to a consolidation of consignments if the insured is the party arranging forwarding and transport services.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Forwarding and consolidation summary message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThe IFCSUM message is a functionality in its own right, distinguishable from the transport booking and instruction messages.\r\nIFCSUM focuses on separate business areas in transport where the view on the operations is transport means or equipment oriented rather than consignment oriented. These business areas do not concentrate on concepts like booking or instruction. The IFCSUM provides currently merely a statement for a means of transport or equipment and their summary type information regarding the consignment carried. The IFCSUM message also provides a means to incorporate the control and auditability information needed for the receiver of the message to perform the operation to be carried out.\r\n\r\nIFCSUM is foreseen to be used:\r\n- in the consolidation and deconsolidation industry (stuffing and stripping of consignments in containers)\r\n- in the groupage and degroupage industry (the full load description of rail-cars and road vehicles)\r\n- in the collection and distribution industry (as the description of all consignments to be collected together (maybe from different places) and delivered at possibly different places in a certain region)\r\n- for the declaration of dangerous cargo by ship's agents to their Port Authorities (as listing of the dangerous cargo carried or to be carried by as means of transport).\r\n\r\nThe message provides information concerning cargo carried on a voyage specifying details regarding carrier, mode of transport, means of transport, equipment and the necessary details of the consignments included in the consolidated cargo.\r\nUnder given circumstances a cargo manifest can be obtained through the use of the IFCSUM.\r\nFor example, a IFCSUM message can be used in groupage traffic, where it may correspond to a loading list indicating the consignments that have been loaded on a truck.\r\n\r\nThere is a need for FUNCTIONAL SUBSETS to be derived from the message, for example:\r\n\r\n- CONSOLIDATION ADVICE giving information about the departure of a voyage/flight or consolidation to the receiver.\r\n\r\n- CONSOLIDATION STATUS giving information about the departure of a voyage/flight or consolidation to principals (e.g. carrier to freight forwarder, consolidator to co-loader etc.).\r\n\r\n- CONSOLIDATION REPORT giving information about the arrival and unloading, clearance, etc. from the receiver to the sender.\r\nAccording to the different information requirements of carriers, carrier's agents, and freight forwarders for the different modes of transport like air, deep sea, inland waterways, rail, road, combined- and/or multimodal- transport different modal subsets can be derived from this message.\r\n\r\nThere is a need for INTRAMODAL SUBSETS to be transmitted between partners of the same mode of transport (e.g. railway to railway in different countries, deep-sea-carrier to deep-sea carrier, freight forwarder to freight forwarder etc.).\r\n\r\nThere is another need for INTERMODAL SUBSETS to be transmitted between partners in a multimodal transport (e.g. freight forwarder to trucker, trucker to railway, railway to port authority, port authority to carrier's agent, carrier's agent to carrier etc.).\r\n\r\n- A consignment may contain several goods items.\r\n\r\n- Goods items may or may not be containerized.\r\n\r\n- A goods item may be transported in one or more containers, and a single container may contain one or more goods items.\r\n\r\n- One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff codes.\r\n\r\n- Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried in one or more containers.\r\n\r\n- Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational description of the goods.\r\n\r\n- Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage (destination haulage) of goods items or equipment within one booking or instruction may take place in different steps, each step specified with its own transport details group.\r\n\r\n- Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it, e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a container.\r\n\r\n- Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or transported on another load or transport device, which as such may be attached to or transported on yet another load or transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis on a rail-car.\r\n\r\n- Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement on their own, are specified in the transport details group.\r\nOther load or transport devices are specified as equipment.\r\n\r\n- The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed at up to three levels.\r\n\r\nFor insurance purposes the message can be used by the carrier to inform the insurer and/or the insurance intermediary about a consolidation of consignments.\r\n\r\nThe transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).\r\nUsers implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.\r\n\r\n2.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Arrival notice message (IFTMAN) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\nThis paper provides the definition of the Arrival Notice Message to be used in fulfilling the requirements of trading partners in the transport chain worldwide, in the interchange of cargo and transport related information using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).\r\n\r\nThis message is a single consignment based message, being aligned with other single consignment based messages such as the booking (IFTMBP,  IFTMBF and IFTMBC) and instruction messages (IFTMIN and IFTMCS). The single consignment based messages can be used by all modes of transport for the forwarding and transport of goods from any origin to any destination, regardless of route or prevailing commercial practice. These messages are suitable for the arrangement of the transport of goods between all parties to the movement of the consignment (including the consignor/shipper and consignee as well as the forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as well as providing the information necessary to perform that transport and delivery of the goods. They should be used in the same way by each mode of transport when the requirements are common even if functionally similar information is known by different names.\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message from the party providing forwarding and/or transport services to the party such as has been indicated in the contract, giving notice and details of the arrival of the consignment.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Arrival notice message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThe notify party might be the consignee or his agent or the customs broker depending on the custom of the port or the conditions in the contract.\r\n\r\n- A consignment may contain several goods items.\r\n\r\n- Goods items may or may not be containerized.\r\n\r\n- A goods item may be transported in one or more containers, and a single container may contain one or more goods items.\r\n\r\n- One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff codes.\r\n\r\n- Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried in one or more containers.\r\n\r\n- Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational description of the goods.\r\n\r\n- Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it, e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a container.\r\n\r\n- Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or transported on another load or transport device, which as such may be attached to or transported on yet another load or transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis on a rail-car.\r\n\r\n- Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement on their own, are specified in the transport details group.\r\nOther load or transport devices are specified as equipment.\r\n\r\n- The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed at up to three levels.\r\n\r\nThe transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).\r\nUsers implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n3.2 Message terms and definitions\r\nA number of generic transport terms are used in this specification, to be described as:\r\n\r\n* MODE OF TRANSPORT: The method of transport used for the conveyance of goods or persons, e.g. by rail, by road, by sea.\r\n\r\n* MEANS OF TRANSPORT: The vehicle used for the transport of goods or persons, e.g. aircraft, truck, vessel.\r\n\r\n* TYPE OF MEANS OF TRANSPORT: The type of vehicle used in the transport process, e.g. wide body, tank truck, passenger vessel.\r\n\r\n* EQUIPMENT: Material resources necessary to facilitate the transport and handling of cargo. Transport equipment does under the given circumstances not have the ability to move by its own propulsion (e.g. sea container, trailer, unit load device, pallet).\r\n\r\n* TYPE OF EQUIPMENT: The type of material used, e.g. 40 feet container, four way pallet, mafi trailer.\r\n\r\n4.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Booking confirmation message (IFTMBC) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\nThis paper provides the definition of the Booking Confirmation Message to be used in fulfilling the requirements of trading partners in the  transport chain worldwide, in the interchange of cargo and transport related information using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).\r\n\r\nThis message is a single consignment based message, being aligned with other single consignment based messages such as the other two booking messages (IFTMBP and IFTMBF), the instruction messages (IFTMIN and IFTMCS) and the Arrival Notice Message (IFTMAN).\r\nThe single consignment based messages can be used by all modes of transport for the forwarding and transport of goods from any origin to any destination, regardless of route or prevailing commercial practice.\r\nThese messages are suitable for the arrangement of the transport of goods between all parties to the movement of the consignment (including the consignor/shipper and consignee as well as the forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as well as providing the information necessary to perform that transport and delivery of the goods.\r\nThey should be used in the same way by each mode of transport when the requirements are common even if functionally similar information is known by different names.\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message from the party providing forwarding and/or transport services to the party booking those services giving the confirmation information to the booking of the consignment concerned. A confirmation might read that the booking of a consignment is accepted, pending, conditionally accepted or rejected.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which requested services take place may be given in this message.\r\n\r\nThis message can also be used between vessel operators, vessel sharing partners and cargo receiving and handling facilities such as marine terminals, inland receiving depots, rail ramps and truck terminals to confirm cargo particulars and equipment requirements of the transport provider to the service provider responsible for dispatching empty equipment and receiving the cargo.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Booking confirmation message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThe message can be used whenever a confirmation of the booking of a consignment is deemed necessary as an answer to a booking provisional or booking firm message concerning a certain consignment. It can also be used to confirm cargo particulars and equipment requirements.\r\n\r\nThe use of a Booking Confirmation Message is not compulsory.\r\n\r\n- A consignment may contain several goods items.\r\n\r\n- Goods items may or may not be containerized.\r\n\r\n- A goods item may be transported in one or more containers, and a single container may contain one or more goods items.\r\n\r\n- One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff codes.\r\n\r\n- Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried in one or more containers.\r\n\r\n- Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational description of the goods.\r\n\r\n- A party to the movement of the consignment may book or order transport for one or more goods items.\r\n\r\n- A party to the movement of the consignment may book or issue instructions of transport to be arranged for several goods items by means of one or several of the following messages: IFTMBP, IFTMBF, IFTMBC, IFTMIN, IFTMCS, IFTMAN.\r\n\r\n- Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage (destination haulage) of goods items or equipment within one booking or instruction may take place in different steps, each step specified with its own transport details group.\r\n\r\n- Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it, e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a container.\r\n\r\n- Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or transported on another load or transport device, which as such may be attached to or transported on yet another load or transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis on a rail-car.\r\n\r\n- Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement on their own, are specified in the transport details group.\r\nOther load or transport devices are specified as equipment.\r\n\r\n- The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed at up to three levels.\r\n\r\nThe transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).\r\nUsers implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.\r\n\r\n2.

IFTMBF,2,Date:\r\n2001-05-15\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nD4 Transport (SWG)\r\n\r\n0. INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Firm booking message (IFTMBF) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\nThis paper provides the definition of the Firm Booking Message to be used in fulfilling the requirements of trading partners in the transport chain worldwide, in the interchange of cargo and transport related information using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).\r\n\r\nThis message is a single consignment based message, being aligned with other single consignment based messages such as the other two booking messages (IFTMBP and IFTMBC), the instruction messages (IFTMIN and IFTMCS) and the Arrival Notice Message (IFTMAN).\r\nThe single consignment based messages can be used by all modes of transport for the forwarding and transport of goods from any origin to any destination, regardless of route or prevailing commercial practice.\r\nThese messages are suitable for the arrangement of the transport of goods between all parties to the movement of the consignment (including the consignor/shipper and consignee as well as the forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as well as providing the information necessary to perform that transport and delivery of the goods.\r\n\r\nThey should be used in the same way by each mode of transport when the requirements are common even if functionally similar information is known by different names.\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message from a party definitely booking forwarding and/or transport services for a consignment to the party providing those services. The message will contain the conditions under which the sender of the messages requires the services to take place.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Firm booking message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nA Firm Booking Message will be sent, usually after an initial space booking has been made. This means that a Firm Booking Message could be sent as the initial message.\r\n\r\nThe message must be seen as a commitment from the shipper to the carrier or forwarder to execute certain services and is used for operational purposes by the service provider.\r\n\r\nA booking-firm can be answered by a confirmation in any form by the service provider but this is not obligatory.\r\n\r\nA booking firm message can be updated/replaced by a new booking firm message. It contains all relevant data elements of a consignment for operational purposes and is followed by an Instruction to ascertain a contract.\r\n\r\n- A consignment may contain several goods items.\r\n\r\n- Goods items may or may not be containerized.\r\n\r\n- A goods item may be transported in one or more containers, and a single container may contain one or more goods items.\r\n\r\n- One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff codes.\r\n\r\n- Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried in one or more containers.\r\n\r\n- Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational description of the goods.\r\n\r\n- A party to the movement of the consignment may book or order transport for one or more goods items.\r\n\r\n- A party to the movement of the consignment may book or issue instructions of transport to be arranged for several goods items by means of one or several of the following messages: IFTMBP, IFTMBF, IFTMBC, IFTMIN, IFTMCS, IFTMAN.\r\n\r\n- Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage (destination haulage) of goods items or equipment within one booking or instruction may take place in different steps, each step specified with its own transport details group.\r\n\r\n- Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it, e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a container.\r\n\r\n- Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or transported on another load or transport device, which as such may be attached to or transported on yet another load or transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis on a rail-car.\r\n\r\n- Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement on their own, are specified in the transport details group.\r\nOther load or transport devices are specified as equipment.\r\n\r\n- The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed at up to three levels.\r\n\r\nThe transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).\r\nUsers implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n3.2 Message terms and definitions\r\nA number of generic transport terms are used in this specification, to be described as:\r\n\r\n* MODE OF TRANSPORT: The method of transport used for the conveyance of goods or persons, e.g. by rail, by road, by sea.\r\n\r\n* MEANS OF TRANSPORT: the vehicle used for the transport of goods or persons, e.g. aircraft, truck, vessel.\r\n\r\n* TYPE OF MEANS OF TRANSPORT: The type of vehicle used in the transport process, e.g. wide body, tank truck, passenger vessel.\r\n\r\n* EQUIPMENT: Material resources necessary to facilitate the transport and handling of cargo.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Instruction message (IFTMIN) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\nThis paper provides the definition of the Instruction Message to be used in fulfilling the requirements of trading partners in the transport chain worldwide, in the interchange of cargo and transport related information using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).\r\n\r\nThis message is a single consignment based message, being aligned with other single consignment based messages such as the booking messages  (IFTMBP, IFTMBF and IFTMBC), the Instruction Contract Status Message (IFTMCS) and the Arrival Notice Message (IFTMAN).\r\nThe single consignment based messages can be used by all modes of transport for the forwarding and transport of goods from any origin to any destination, regardless of route or prevailing commercial practice.\r\n\r\nThese messages are suitable for the arrangement of the transport of goods between all parties to the movement of the consignment (including the consignor/shipper and consignee as well as the forwarders, brokers, and carriers involved) as well as providing the information necessary to perform that transport and delivery of the goods.\r\n\r\nThey should be used in the same way by each mode of transport when the requirements are common even if functionally similar information is known by different names.\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message from the party issuing an instruction regarding forwarding/transport services for a consignment under conditions agreed, to the party arranging the forwarding and/or transport services.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Instruction message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThe instruction results in a transport contract for a consignment and is primarily meant for administrative purposes.\r\nIt will be the message from shipper to carrier or forwarder containing the final details of  the consignment for which services are provided. The instruction message is the one and only message which results in the actual contract which can either be a document or an electronic contract.\r\n\r\nIf only one message will suffice in an exchange between a shipper and a carrier/forwarder the instruction message should be the one as this message is the only message that results in a contract. The receiving party is to ascertain whether the Instruction message is preceded by a Booking Firm message, to be able to interpret the function as being an administrative message only or an administrative and operational message.\r\n\r\n- A consignment may contain several goods items.\r\n\r\n- Goods items may or may not be containerized.\r\n\r\n- A goods item may be transported in one or more containers, and a single container may contain one or more goods items.\r\n\r\n- One goods item may be related to one or more customs tariff codes.\r\n\r\n- Goods items related to one customs tariff code may be carried in one or more containers.\r\n\r\n- Goods items may reflect either the contractual or operational description of the goods.\r\n\r\n- A party to the movement of the consignment may book or order transport for one or more goods items.\r\n\r\n- A party to the movement of the consignment may book or issue instructions of transport to be arranged for several goods items by means of one or several of the following messages: IFTMBP, IFTMBF, IFTMBC, IFTMIN, IFTMCS, IFTMAN.\r\n\r\n- Pre-carriage (advanced haulage) and/or on-carriage (destination haulage) of goods items or equipment within one booking or instruction may take place in different steps, each step specified with its own transport details group.\r\n\r\n- Equipment may have other types of equipment attached to it, e.g. a temperature control unit attached to a container.\r\n\r\n- Equipment and/or goods items may be attached to or transported on another load or transport device, which as such may be attached to or transported on yet another load or transport device, e.g. a container on a chassis on a rail-car.\r\n\r\n- Transport devices, which have the ability of powered movement on their own, are specified in the transport details group.\r\nOther load or transport devices are specified as equipment.\r\n\r\n- The expression of packaging for goods items can be expressed at up to three levels.\r\n\r\nThe transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).\r\nUsers implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n3.2 Message terms and definitions\r\nA number of generic transport terms are used in this specification, to be described as:\r\n\r\n* MODE OF TRANSPORT: The method of transport used for the conveyance of goods or persons, e.g. by rail, by road, by sea.\r\n\r\n* MEANS OF TRANSPORT: The vehicle used for the transport of goods or persons, e.g. aircraft, truck, vessel.\r\n\r\n* TYPE OF MEANS OF TRANSPORT: The type of vehicle used in the transport process, e.g. wide body, tank truck, passenger vessel.\r\n\r\n* EQUIPMENT: Material resources necessary to facilitate the transport and handling of cargo.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the International multimodal status report message (IFTSTA) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message to report the transport status and/or a change in the transport status (i.e. event) between agreed parties.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe International multimodal status report message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThis message allows for the exchange of information regarding the status of the physical movement of consignments, goods or equipment at any point (in time or place) within the full transport chain.\r\n\r\nA status message may be sent:\r\n- as the result of request/s for consignment/s or equipment status/es\r\n- on a scheduled basis at predetermined times\r\n- on the occurrence of a selected event/s\r\n- on the occurrence of an exceptional event as agreed by the partners involved.\r\n\r\nThis message can relate to a status (or statuses) that has or have been reached in a transport chain.\r\n\r\nData requirements for tracking equipment where equipment is not associated with a consignment (such as repair container) are NOT addressed in this message.\r\n\r\nThe transport sub-working group (D4) has developed recommendations for a harmonised implementation of this message through its subgroup ITIGG (International Transport Implementation Guidelines Group).\r\nUsers implementing the message are strongly advised to apply these recommendations, which may be obtained from the D4 secretariat.\r\n\r\n2.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Instruction to despatch message (INSDES) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message from a party to another party who has control over ordered goods, providing instructions to put on hold or to despatch a consignment according to conditions specified in the message.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Instruction to despatch message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nDepending on circumstances the Instruction to Despatch message may be sent either from a buyer to a supplier (see point 1.3.1 below), or from a supplier or buyer to a third party service provider (see point 1.3.2 below).\r\n\r\nThe Instruction to Despatch message may be used to;\r\n\r\n- request the delivery of goods being held by a third party (e.g., warehouse, logistic service provider) on behalf of a buyer or supplier.\r\n- request the delivery of goods being held by the supplier until the buyer is in a position to receive them. For example, when ordering equipment for a new building the purchase order for the equipment will be issued before the start of physical building. As the building progresses equipment will be requested for delivery, for installation before the next phase of building starts, e.g., the heating system.\r\n- identify the exact delivery location;\r\n- identify the date on which delivery should take place;\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nThe Instruction to Despatch message must not be used to;\r\n\r\n- change information previously agreed on an order, e.g., price, ordered quantities, etc. The Purchase Order Change message must be used for this purpose.\r\n- order transport services for the despatch of the goods identified in the message. The message Transport Instruction must be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n1.3.1 Buyer to Supplier\r\n\r\nThe Instruction to Despatch message may be used by a buyer to inform his seller to release the despatch of goods previously ordered. In addition the message may be used to instruct the seller to hold the despatch of goods which have been previously reported as being ready for despatch.\r\n\r\n1.3.2 Buyer or Supplier to Third Party Service Provider.\r\n\r\nWhen the message is sent from a supplier or a buyer to a third party service provider it may be used to request the service provider to despatch specified goods, identify the delivery location, identify the date on which delivery should take place, and, or indicate that the despatch is subject to cash on delivery, etc.\r\n\r\nBecause the third party service provider is outside the normal buyer to supplier order process the Instruction to Despatch message may be used by the supplier or buyer to inform the third party service provider of information stated in the order which is required for the effective despatch of the goods, e.g., terms of delivery, transport equipment required for the delivery, etc.\r\n\r\n2.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Invoice message (INVOIC) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message claiming payment for goods or services supplied under conditions agreed between the seller and the buyer.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations Standard Invoice Message, with correct data qualification, serves also as the specification for Debit Note and Credit Note messages. Throughout this document, the reference to 'Invoice' may be interpreted as conveying the wider meaning of 'Invoice/Credit Note/Debit Note'.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Invoice message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\n- A seller may invoice for one or more transactions\r\n\r\n- An invoice may refer to goods, items or services related to one or more orders, delivery instructions, call-offs, etc.\r\n\r\n- An invoice may contain references to payment terms\r\n\r\n- An invoice for cross border transactions may contain additional information for customs and/or statistical purposes/services\r\n\r\n- An invoice may contain transport details.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nAll specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhere a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\n\r\nConditional data that is not required in the message should not be included.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.\r\n\r\nFree text information within the message should be avoided as this inhibits automatic processing.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Inventory report message (INVRPT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\nThis paper provides the definition of the United Nations Standard Inventory Report Message to be used in Electronic Data Interchange between trading partners.\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message specifying information relating to held inventories.\r\nThe Inventory report message is intended to be used in either direction between trading partners.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Inventory report message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThe exchanged information will relate to inventories of raw materials, manufactured articles, or other stockable items, and can be exchanged between a manufacturer and distributor (wholesaler), or manufacturer and consignment holder, etc.\r\n\r\nThe message includes functionality to differentiate classes of inventory, and to permit financial valuation of inventories facilitating price protection claims, auditing, statutory declarations, planning of production and deliveries, etc.\r\n\r\nThe specified quantities relating to a product can indicate opening stock, closing stock, and goods movement (receipts or withdrawals) of held inventory, for a given time frame.\r\n\r\nThe specified quantities can relate directly to a product or package, and may be sub-detailed within different groups or classes, e.g., batch, age, valuation, location, etc.\r\n\r\nFor every specified quantity it is possible to indicate the relative package identifications of the physical units involved.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guide-lines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nAll specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/ 'hhmm' unless all the parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative form.\r\nPeriods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated to the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).\r\n\r\nWhere a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\n\r\nConditional data that is not required in the message should not be included.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of the group.
MSCONS~1~1,0,Senders unique message reference. Sequence number of messages in the interchange. DE 0062 in UNT will have the same value. Generated by the sender.

MSCONS~2~1~1,1,It is of critical importance to use the appropriate document name qualifier relevant to the message.\r\nCode values 94E and 99E for this DE are temporary. Appropriate EDIFACT code values will be requested by EAN.  In data element 3055 the code value '9' identifying EAN must be used to signify that the code value is an EAN specific value.\r\nFor application routing purposes users may decide which value to use in data element 1001.  Code value 99E is used to provide metered services consumption and quality data for multiple premises in support of consumption related information. This consumption and quality information may be routed towards process control, energy management,  or other technical systems. Code value 94E is used to provide metered services consumption data for a single premise and will be routed to financial systems.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Metered services consumption report message (MSCONS) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA metered services consumption report is a communication between trading parties, or their agents, providing consumption and where associated technical, information at a location(s) for a product(s) or service(s) where the supply is recorded using a meter(s).\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Metered services consumption report message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\n- At least one delivery party (premise) shall be identified per message.\r\n\r\n- Each metered services consumption report will define the period of time for which the details contained are valid.\r\n\r\n- A metered services consumption report may be used to provide consumption information which may directly relate to other business functions, e.g. invoicing or process control.\r\n\r\n- A metered services consumption report may be sent by the buyer or the seller to the other party.\r\n\r\n- Metered services consumption report will be provided for premises as defined by trading partners.\r\n\r\n- Locations, products and, or services, and meters shall be identified where ever possible within the report using codes to facilitate automatic processing.\r\n\r\n- The metered services consumption report may be transmitted at any time and may be related directly to either a delivery(ies) and, or an invoice(s).\r\n\r\n- A metered services consumption report when used to support the financial information contained in an invoice may only relate to one invoice.\r\n\r\n- A metered services consumption report when used to indicate consumption or qualitative information may relate to one or many delivery parties (premises).\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\n- Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\n\r\n- Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be included.\r\n\r\n- Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.\r\n\r\n- Free text information within the message should be avoided as this inhibits automatic processing. It is only used when additional information that cannot be accommodated within the other segments is required.

ORDCHG~101~3~1,0,Format n..14\r\nGTIN - this is the number of the article being changed.
ORDCHG~101~3,0,This composite will only be used for the identification of EAN/UPC codes. If another coding structure is being used, e.g. HIBC, this composite will not be used and the code will be detailed in the PIA segment.
ORDCHG~101,4,The detail section of the Purchase Order Change Request is formed by a repeating group of segments, always starting with the LIN segment.\r\nExample:\r\nLIN+1+2+5412345111115:SRV'\r\nDependency Notes:\r\nC829 is only used when sub-lines are required.\r\nFOR A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION ON THE USAGE OF SUB-LINES PLEASE REFER TO PART I, SECTION 4.10.
ORDCHG~101,5,If Global Trade Item Numbers are available it is mandatory to use GTIN within the LIN segment.
ORDCHG~102~1,1,Product Id function coded has the following restricted coded functions:\r\n1 - Additional Identification - To provide an additional identity for the product identified in the LIN segment. The additional identification can consist of :\r\nA supplemental identification which provides more information complementary to the main GTIN provided in the LIN segment, e.g., a batch number, promotional variant number, product group number, etc.\r\nAn alternative identification which may be used instead of the main GTIN provided in the LIN segment, e.g., a buyers or sellers article number, an HIBC code, etc.\r\n4 - Substituted for - To provide the number of a product which has been substituted for the product identified by the number provided in the LIN segment.\r\nIn the Purchase Order Change Request this function code may be used to inform trading partners of the trade item number of the product originally ordered which has been substituted for another product identified in the LIN segment.\r\n5 - Product Identification  - To provide the primary product identification code when no GTIN has been provided in the LIN segment.\r\nX1 - No Substitution Accepted - The buyer will not accept any other product code than the one specified in the LIN segment. The code specified in the LIN segment is repeated in the PIA segment to confirm the only code acceptable.
ORDCHG~102,4,This segment is used to specify additional or substitutional item identification codes such as a buyers, or sellers item number.\r\nExample:\r\nPIA+1+ABC1234:IN'\r\nIn this example the PIA segment is used to provide an additional identification to the trade item number provided in the LIN segment. The GTIN  5412345111115 provided in the LIN segment refers to the internal buyer's item number.\r\nPIA+4+5412345111184:SRV'\r\nIn this example the PIA segment is used to provide a GTIN of the product which has been substituted by the new (substitute) product being ordered, identified in the LIN segment by the GTIN 5412345111115.\r\nPIA+5+2209953C001L:AC'\r\nThis example details the HIBC code 2209953C001L which is provided as the primary product code because no GTIN was provided in the LIN segment.\r\nPIA+X1+4000862141404:SRV'\r\nThis example details the situation where the buyer explicitly specifies that no other product Id is acceptable but the one specified in the LIN segment. The PIA re-specifies the product code from the LIN segment.
ORDCHG~103~2~3,0,Must be used if DE7081 contains an EAN Code.
ORDCHG~103,4,This segment is used to describe the current line item.\r\nIt is recommended that this segment only be used for coded descriptions. Data element 7008 in clear text should only be used when no product code is available or when free-form descriptions are required by trading partners.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Purchase order change request message (ORDCHG) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message from the buyer to the seller, specifying details of the buyer's request to change a purchase order.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Purchase order change request message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nA buyer may request to change, or eventually cancel one or more goods items or services.\r\n\r\nA purchase order change request may refer to goods items or services related to one or more delivery schedules, call-offs, etc.\r\n\r\nA purchase order change request for cross-border transactions may contain additional information for customs and/or statistical purposes.\r\n\r\nA purchase order change request may contain details for transport and destination as well as delivery patterns.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nFor guidance, the following principles serve to remove ambiguity in the application of an EDI Purchase Order Change.\r\n\r\nAll specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).\r\n\r\nWhere a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\n\r\nConditional data that is not required in the message should not be included.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.\r\n\r\nFree text information within the message should be avoided as this inhibits automatic processing.
ORDERS~1~1,0,Sender's unique message reference. Sequence number of the messages in the interchange. DE 0062 in the UNT will be exactly the same. Sender generated.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Purchase order message (ORDERS) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message specifying details for goods or services ordered under conditions agreed between the seller and the buyer.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Purchase order message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\n- A buyer may order for one or more goods items or services.\r\n\r\n- A purchase order may refer to goods items or services related to one or more delivery schedules, call-offs, etc.\r\n\r\n- A purchase order for cross-border transactions may contain additional information for customs and/or statistical purposes.\r\n\r\n- A purchase order may contain details for transport and destination as well as delivery patterns.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nAll specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhere a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\n\r\nConditional data that is not required in the message should not be included.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.\r\n\r\nFree text information within the message should be avoided as this inhibits automatic processing.

ORDRSP~2~2~1,1,It is recommended that the length of document number be restricted to a maximum of 17 characters.
ORDRSP~2~3,1,When code 45 is used in this position, confirmation is provided at a later stage by issuing a new ORDRSP which once again replies to the original Purchase Order, and also refers to the provisional Purchase Order Response.\r\nThe message function, coded is a critical element in this segment. The restricted codes detailed in DE 1225 have the following definitions:\r\n4 = Change - The supplier accepts to supply the goods or services requested in the Purchase Order or Purchase Order Change Request, but requires changes to one or more of the items.\r\n12 = Not processed - The supplier informs the buyer that the referenced message has been received but has not yet been processed completely.\r\n27 = Not accepted - The supplier declines to supply the goods detailed in a Purchase Order or Purchase Order Change Request.\r\n29 = Accepted without amendment  - The supplier accepts to supply the goods or services requested according to the terms set out in the Purchase Order or Purchase Order Change Request.

OSTRPT,2,Date:\r\n2001-05-15\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nD2 Purchasing (SWG)\r\n\r\n0. INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Order status report message (OSTRPT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message between a buyer or buyer's agent and a seller or seller's agent reporting status information on the current status of a previously sent order(s). This may be a reply to an order status enquiry or a report as agreed between the partners.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Order status report message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThis message covers one seller and one buyer and may relate to:\r\n\r\n- one enquiry\r\n\r\n- one or more purchase orders\r\n\r\n- specific lines within purchase orders\r\n\r\nThe status can not trigger any action by the receiver of the message. For example, if the status is 'ready for shipment', it can not be used as a despatch advice information. A DESADV message, or an equivalent document, has to be sent as well.\r\n\r\nThis message can only be used to provide status information.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\n- All specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\n\r\n- Conditional data that is required in the message should be omitted.\r\n\r\n- Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments does not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.\r\n\r\n- Free text information within the message should be avoided as this inhibits automatic processing.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Party information message (PARTIN) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message to enable the transmission of basic information regarding locations and the related operational, administrative, financial, manufacturing, confirmation of registration and trading data.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Party information message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThe accurate and unambiguous identification of the trading partners and their operational parameters is an essential issue for EDI.\r\n\r\nThe Party Information Message serves to maintain the partners master data files.\r\n\r\nNote: Once the data available in master data files is established:\r\n- identifying codes should be used instead of clear data\r\n- clear data is to be used if it is required to override the data from a particular transaction.\r\n\r\nThe Party Information Message is used to specify information related to physical locations and to functional locations. A functional location is usually a specific department within a company.\r\n\r\nThe change, delete, add indicator being given in the BGM segment, one separate message has to be provided per type of function required.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nAll specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhere a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\nConditional data that is not required in the message should not be included.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.\r\n\r\nFree text information within the message should be avoided as this inhibits automatic processing.

PAYMUL,2,Date:\r\n2001-05-15\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nD6 Finance (SWG)\r\n\r\n0. INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Multiple payment order message (PAYMUL) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA Multiple Payment order is sent by the Ordering Customer (or Payor or Agent on behalf of the Ordering Customer) to the Ordered Bank, to instruct the Ordered Bank to debit an account it services for the Ordering Customer, and to arrange for the payment of specified amounts to several Beneficiaries (or Payees) in settlement of the referenced business transaction(s).\r\n\r\nThroughout this document, the term 'Ordering Customer' refers to either an Ordering Customer, or a Payor or Agent acting (sending) on behalf of the Ordering Customer; likewise the term 'Beneficiary' refers to either a Beneficiary, or a Payee or Agent acting on behalf of the Beneficiary.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Multiple payment order message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\nThis message may be applied for both national and international settlements.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\n- A Multiple Payment Order may cover the financial settlement of one or more commercial trade transactions such as invoices credit notes, debit notes etc. It is not intended for use in securities trading.\r\n\r\n- Charges may be borne on account(s) different of the account(s) held by the Ordering Customer.\r\n\r\n- Several debit accounts, execution dates and currencies may be specified.\r\n\r\n- The Ordered Bank may need a confirmation/authorization (e.g.\r\nAUTHOR message) to be allowed to process the Multiple Payment Order message.\r\n\r\n- The only way to modify a Multiple Payment Order message is to cancel the whole message or part thereof (e.g. by the use of the FINCAN message). In that respect, one to many order(s) could be cancelled within the message, avoiding to be obliged to cancel the whole message.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following semantic principles applying to the message are intended to facilitate the understanding of the message:\r\n\r\nThe Multiple Payment Order message is structured in three levels:\r\n\r\nA,B, and C. In the Branching Diagram, level A corresponds to page 1, level B corresponds to page 2, and level C corresponds to pages\r\n3 and 4.\r\n\r\n-A level contains data related to the whole message and is contained in Segment Group 1 and Segment Group 2 and the Heading section.\r\n\r\n-B level contains data from the debit side (one debit account, one currency, one execution date) and data which applies to all further details of C level(s) and is contained in Segment Group 3 through Segment Group 9.\r\n\r\n-C level contains mainly data related to the credit side, and this data is considered as unique for each payment transaction and is contained in Segment Group 10 through Segment Group 21.\r\n\r\n- The structure of the message is designed to allow several B levels, each B level being followed by its related C levels.\r\n\r\nWhere a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.
PRICAT~1~1,0,Senders unique message reference. Sequence number of messages in the interchange. DE 0062 in UNT will have the same value. Generated by the sender.
PRICAT~1~2~5,1,Indicates that the message is an EANCOM version 008 of the UNSM Price/Sales Catalogue.
PRICAT~1,4,Price/Sales Catalogue Heading Section\r\nThis segment is used to head, identify and specify a message.\r\nDE's 0065, 0052, 0054, and 0051: Indicate that the message is a UNSM Price/Sales Catalogue based on the D.01B directory under the control of the United Nations.\r\nExample:\r\nUNH+ME000001+PRICAT:D:01B:UN:EAN008'
PRICAT~2~1~1,1,It is of critical importance to use the appropriate document name qualifier relevant to the message. Codes 24E and 25E are to be used to explicitly indicate whether a catalogue contains only pricing information (e.g. PRI, ALC, TAX, etc.) or only technical information (e.g. IMD, MEA, HAN, etc.) and to allow application routing to take place depending on the value expressed here.
PRICAT~2~1~3,0,This data element is used with code value 9 when EAN codes are used in DE 1001.
PRICAT~2~2~1,0,Price/sales catalogue message number.
PRICAT~2~3,1,The message function, coded is a critical data element in this segment. It applies to all data indicated in the message. The following definitions apply for the restricted codes:\r\n2 = Addition - This code is used to add new or to provide information on existing products for the first time to the trading partner.\r\n3 = Deletion  - This code is used to delete products from a partner's master file. In the case of deletion each LIN segment to be deleted must be sent in the detail section.\r\n4 = Change - This code is used to modify any information relevant to a product already known by the trading partner. Only the segments containing modified information needs to be sent. All previously sent data in a modified segment must be provided. All occurrences (repetitions) of a modified segment must be provided (whether modified or not).\r\n5 = Replace - To replace a previously sent message identified in the RFF segment of the heading section.\r\n6 = Confirmation - This code is used when product information contained in a previous transmission is sent again for confirmation purposes.\r\n7 = Duplicate - This code is used when the message is a duplicate of a previously generated message.\r\n9 = Original - An original transmission of a Price/sales catalogue.\r\n27 = Not accepted - This code is used in a PRICAT response to inform the recipient that the referenced PRICAT message was not accepted.\r\n29 = Accepted without amendment - This code is used in a PRICAT response to inform the recipient that the referenced PRICAT message was accepted completely.\r\n31 = Copy - This code indicates that the message is a copy of an original message that has been sent, e.g. for action or information.\r\n46 = Provisional - This code is used to indicate that the content of the price/sales catalogue message is provisional and is subject to final approval (using code 47).\r\n47 = Definitive - This code is used  to indicate that the content of the price/sales catalogue message is definitive.\r\nWhen code value '46, Provisional' is used, it is recommended that a subsequent message using code value '47, Definitive' should follow.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Price/sales catalogue message (PRICAT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message to enable the transmission of information regarding pricing and catalogue details for goods and services offered by a seller to a buyer.\r\nThe message can also be sent by a buyer to a seller. This may be a response (acceptance or rejection) to a previously received price/sales catalogue message, or a notification of negotiated prices.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Price/sales catalogue message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\n- A Price/Sales Catalogue Message Pricing-group or item may refer to either goods items or services.\r\n\r\n- The Price items are structured together according to industrial or commercial requirements.\r\n\r\n- The sales and delivery conditions within a Price/Sales Catalogue Message may refer to:\r\n\r\n. all product/service items of the Price/Sales Catalogue Message,\r\n. a group of product/service items,\r\n. a single product/service item in the message,\r\n. within a single product/service item to different price basis occurrences.\r\n\r\n- A Price/Sales Catalogue Message may contain product and price information, as well as sales conditions.\r\n\r\n- The Price Item Line may identify the component parts of the price item.\r\n\r\nWhen using the price/sales catalogue message to provide a response, the message sender may specify this information in one of two ways:\r\n\r\n- The total acceptance or rejection of a previous price/sales catalogue message;\r\n\r\n- The rejection of information either at a product group level or at an individual product level.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nAll specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated in the date/time/period format (weeks, months, etc.).\r\n\r\nConditional data that is not required in the message should not be included.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of the group.\r\n\r\nFree text information within the message should be avoided as this inhibits automatic processing.

This code is used to add new or to provide information on existing products for the first time to the trading partner.\r\n3 = Deletion (DE 1229 in LIN is 2 = Deletion). This code is used to delete products from a partner's master file. In the case of deletion, only the LIN segment needs to be sent in the detail section.\r\n4 = Change (DE 1229 in LIN is 3 = Change). This code is used to modify any information relevant to a product already known by the trading partner. Only the segments containing modified information needs to be sent. All previously sent data in a modified segment must be provided. All occurrences (repetitions) of a modified segment must be provided (whether modified or not).\r\n5 = Replace - To replace a previously sent message identified in the RFF segment of the heading section.\r\n6 = Confirmation (DE 1229 in LIN is 4 = No Change).

PRODAT~38~3,0,This composite is only used for the identification of EAN/UPC codes. If another coding structure is required, e.g. HIBC, this composite will not be used and the code will be detailed in the PIA segment.
PRODAT~38,4,This segment is used to identify the line item for which product data is being provided.
PRODAT~38,5,If Global Trade Item Numbers are available it is mandatory to use GTIN within the LIN segment.\r\nExample:\r\nLIN+1++5412345123453:SRV'
PRODAT~39~1,1,Product Id function, coded has the following restricted coded functions:\r\n1 - Additional identification - To provide an additional identity for the primary GTIN identified in the LIN segment. The additional code can consist of:\r\nA supplemental identification which provides more information complementary to the main GTIN  provided in the LIN segment, e.g., a batch number, promotional variant number, etc, or an alternative identification which may be used instead of the main GTIN provided in the LIN segment, e.g., a buyer's article number, an HIBC code, etc,.\r\n2 - Identification for  potential substitution - To provide the GTIN of a product which can substitute the product identified by the GTIN provided in the LIN segment when the latter is temporarily unavailable, e.g., a similar or identical product coded with a different GTIN (article coded in a different country), a different size unit of the same product, a similar product with for example a different brand name.\r\n3 - Substituted by - To provide the GTIN of a product which has substituted the product identified in the LIN segment.\r\nIn the Product Data message this function code may be used to inform trading partners of a  number change relevant to a product. In this case, the LIN segment will contain the old trade item number and the 'Substituted By' PIA segment, the new trade item number.\r\n4 - Substituted for - To provide the GTIN of a product which has been substituted for the product identified by the GTIN in the LIN segment.\r\nIn the Product Data message this function code may be used to inform trading partners of a number change relevant to a product. In this case, the LIN segment will contain the new GTIN and the 'Substituted  For' PIA segment will identify the old GTIN which has been substituted.\r\n5 - Product Identification  - To provide the primary product identification code when no GTIN has been provided in the LIN segment.\r\nX1 - No substitution accepted - The buyer will not accept any other product code than the one specified in the LIN segment. The code specified in the LIN segment is repeated in the PIA segment to confirm the only code acceptable.
PRODAT~39,4,This segment is used to identify additional product codes for the current line item.\r\nExamples:\r\nPIA+1+ABF5682:IN'\r\nIn this example the PIA segment is used to provide an additional identification to the GTIN provided in the LIN segment.

The product identified with the GTIN 5412345123453 in the LIN segment can be substituted by the product identified in the current PIA segment by the GTIN 5412345111184 in case the former is not available.\r\nPIA+3+5412345111184:SRV'\r\nIn this example the 'Substituted By' PIA segment is used to identify a number which is replacing the current primary GTIN. The current  number is identified in the 'Product Identification' PIA segment.\r\nPIA+4+5410738251028:SRV'\r\nIn this example the 'Substituted For' PIA segment is used to provide the number of the product which is being substituted for the former primary GTIN. The new code 5412345111184 would be included in the message in the 'Product Identification' PIA segment.\r\nPIA+5+2209953C001L:AC'\r\nThis example details the HIBC code 2209953C001L which is provided as the primary product code because no GTIN was provided in the LIN segment.\r\nPIA+X1+5412345111115:SRV'\r\nThis example details the situation where the buyer explicitly specifies that no other product is acceptable but the one specified in the LIN segment. The PIA re-specifies the product code from the LIN segment.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Product data message (PRODAT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message to submit master data - a set of data that is rarely changed - to identify and describe products a supplier offers to his (potential) customer or buyer. This information of long validity includes technical and functional product description but not commercial terms and conditions. This message can be used as well to update the information on a previously sent PRODAT message.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Product data message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThis message provides product identification and description on the full or partial range of deliverable goods a supplier offers to his customers. It might be offered to a single customer, a multitude of customers and to agents as well.\r\n\r\nThe information enables customers to select goods according to appropriate needs. To achieve this the subsequent details may be provided on specified goods:\r\n\r\n+ products characteristics\r\n+ technical data\r\n+ utilisation description\r\n+ utilisation requirements\r\n+ handling information\r\n\r\nThe information may be provided either structured or in free format.\r\n\r\nThis message provides capability to identify technical information being mandatory for ordering.\r\nDescriptive and, or identifying parts of this message can be copied into orders as required.\r\n\r\n2.

PROINQ,2,Date:\r\n2001-05-15\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nD2 Purchasing (SWG)\r\n\r\n0. INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Product inquiry message (PROINQ) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message enabling the sender to inquire on a product or a group of products from a master product catalogue or file according to criteria defined in the message.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Product inquiry message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThe message usually relates to a manufacturer and/or a supplier of goods and a buyer, or their respective agents.\r\n\r\nThe buyer may specify in the message the attributes of a product or group of products for which additional information is required. This will allow a manufacturer and/or supplier to send the requester only information for those products the requester is specifically interested in rather than the entire product catalogue.\r\n\r\nThe Product inquiry message may request information in order to:\r\n\r\n- select a specific group or family or products from a supplier entire product catalogue, e.g. a buyer requesting a supplier of medical equipment all product information related to sterilized products.\r\n\r\n- select a product or group of products according to attributes or product characteristics as defined by the sender in the message, e.g. a retailer requesting a clothing manufacturer to send product information for all blue, white or stripped men's shirts, sizes medium to extra-large.\r\n\r\n- determine the availability, lead-time and/or general commercial and/or sales conditions for a specific product.\r\n\r\nThe response to a product inquiry message will be either a Price/sales catalogue (PRICAT) or Product data message (PRODAT).\r\n\r\nPROINQ shall not be used to request a code.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\n- All specified dates and/or times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative format.\r\n\r\n- Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).\r\n\r\n- Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\n\r\n- Conditional data that is not required in the message should not be included.\r\n\r\n- Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Quote message (QUOTES) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message which provides potential sellers with the ability to provide price, delivery schedule, and other conditions for potential sales of goods or services.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Quote message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\n- A potential seller may offer one or more goods items or services.\r\n\r\n- A quotation may refer to goods items or services related to one or more delivery schedules, call-offs, etc.\r\n\r\n- A quotation for cross border transactions may contain additional information for customs and/or statistical purposes.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3.

RECADV~69,4,This segment is used to identify the product received.
RECADV~69,5,If Global Trade Item Numbers are available it is mandatory to use GTIN within the LIN segment.\r\nIf a product has been delivered but not accepted it must be identified using a separate line item. In these cases the received and accepted quantities are zero. Such products might include unknown or not ordered products, excess deliveries, damaged goods, unacceptable product variants or batch numbers, different pack size, etc.. Reasons for the action is detailed in the QTY-QVR-DTM segments.\r\nExample:\r\nLIN+1++5412345123453:SRV'\r\nDependency Notes:\r\nC829 is only used when sub-lines are required.\r\nFOR A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION ON THE USAGE OF SUB-LINES PLEASE REFER TO PART I, SECTION 4.10.

RECADV~72~1~3,0,This DE is only used if the current product is of variable quantity.
RECADV~72,4,This segment is used to specify any quantities related to the current line item.\r\nExample:\r\nQTY+194:150'
RECADV~73~1~1,0,Specify the actual variance amount here.
RECADV~73,4,This segment is used to specify any variances between what was received and accepted and what was ordered/shipped.\r\nIf the quantity received and/or accepted is less than the quantity expected by the receiver (e.g. damaged goods not accepted), the value of QVR, DE 6064 must be expressed as a negative.\r\nIf the quantity received and/or accepted is greater than the quantity expected by the receiver (e.g. overshipped), the value of QVR, DE 6064 must be expressed as a positive.\r\nExample:\r\nQVR+40:195+AC'\r\n40 units of the current line item were received but not accepted because they were over shipped. These extra units will be returned to the supplier.
RECADV~74~1~1,1,'200, Pick-up/collection date of cargo' - may be used to specify the collection date of goods being returned,  and may be used in conjunction with QVR segment DE 6063 qualifier '195, Received not accepted, to be returned'.\r\n'61, Cancel if not delivered by this date' - may be used in back-order situations and may be used in conjunction with QVR segment DE 4221 code BP = Shipment partial, back order to follow.\r\n'360, Sell by date' - may be used to specify the sell by date of rejected products and may be used in conjunction with QVR segment DE 4295 code PE = minimum/maximum durability date unacceptable.
RECADV~74,4,This segment is used to specify dates related to the current line item.\r\nExample:\r\nDTM+200:20021115:102'

RECADV~100~1~1,0,Specify the actual variance amount here.
RECADV~100,4,This segment is used to specify quantity variances for the current line item which is contained in the package marked with the Serial Shipping Container Code identified in the following GIN segment.\r\nFor negative values (e.g. damaged goods not accepted) the variance must be expressed as negative.\r\nDE 6064 and 6063: These DE's must be used to indicate the quantity not being accepted which is the difference between the despatched (delivered) quantity and the received and accepted quantity.\r\nExample:\r\nQVR+40:195+AC'
RECADV~105,4,This segment is used to provide the Serial Shipping Container Code marked on the packaging of the current line item.\r\nDE C208: If a sequential series of identity numbers is provided (e.g., 1 up to and including 10) only one repetition of the C208 composite is needed with the first repetition of 7402 specifying the numerically smaller identity number (e.g., 1) and the second repetition the larger identity number (e.g., 10). If identity numbers are not sequential and part of a series (e.g., 1, 3, and 10) then a separate C208 and DE 7402 must be used for each identity number.\r\nWithin internal applications, users may provide a range of Serial Shipping Container Codes using one repetition of C208 (as described above) by transmitting a 17 digit SSCC and calculating the check digit within the application.\r\nIn EANCOM it is recommended to use the Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) for unique identification of individual transport packages.\r\nExample:\r\nGIN+BJ+354123450000000014'

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Remittance advice message (REMADV) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nThe Remittance Advice is a communication between trading partners, e.g. seller, buyer, financial institutions, which provides a detailed accounting relative to a payment, or other form of financial settlement, for the provision of goods and/or services as detailed in the advice.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Remittance advice message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\n- A Remittance Advice is a notice of a payment to be made.\r\n\r\n- A Remittance Advice may cover one or more commercial trade transactions (and related financial transactions), such as invoices, credit notes, debit notes, etc.\r\n\r\n- A Remittance Advice may include a cross reference to a Payment Order.\r\n\r\n- A single Remittance Advice may relate to both national and international settlements.\r\n\r\n- Each Remittance Advice shall be calculated in only one currency, even though the related transaction is denominated in different currencies.\r\n\r\n- Each Remittance Advice shall relate to only one settlement date.\r\n\r\n- Where remittance advice relates to a dispute, the message :\r\n\r\n. does not necessarily relate to one settlement date\r\n. is not necessarily a notice for a payment to be made\r\n\r\n- A Remittance Advice may be initiated by either party according to agreements.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nAll specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhere a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\n\r\nConditional data that is not required in the message should not be included.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.\r\n\r\nFree text information within the message should be avoided as this inhibits automatic processing.

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Request for quote message (REQOTE) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message which provides potential buyers with the ability to solicit price, delivery schedule, and other conditions from potential sellers of goods or services.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Request for quote message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\n- A potential buyer may solicit offers for one or more goods items or services.\r\n\r\n- A request for quote may refer to goods items or services related to one or more delivery schedules, call-offs, etc.\r\n\r\n- A request for quote for cross border transactions may contain additional information for customs and/or statistical purposes.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nAll specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhere a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\n\r\nData that is not necessary to meet the functional requirements of the message should not be included.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment.\r\n\r\nFree text information within the message should be avoided as this inhibits automatic processing.

RETANN,2,Date:\r\n2001-05-15\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nD1 Materials Management (SWG)\r\n\r\n0. INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Announcement for returns message (RETANN) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message by which a party announces to another party details of goods for return due to specified reasons (e.g. returns for repair, returns at end of leasing period, returns because of damage).\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Announcement for returns message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThis message may be used by the message sender to request credit for goods, or the replacement of goods from the message recipient.\r\n\r\nThis message should stimulate the message recipient to instruct on how the named goods should be returned, destroyed, or disposed of.\r\n\r\nIn the case where the recipient of the announcement refuses to accept the return of goods the sender would expect to receive notification of this decision and also instructions on what should happen instead of the return. This process will usually be handled using the Instruction for Return message.\r\n\r\nThe announcement for returns can be used by a party to inform another party on the requested return of:\r\n\r\n-    goods received in bad condition;\r\n-    goods received but not ordered;\r\n-    goods for repair;\r\n-    goods which have to be returned due to the end of a leasing contract;\r\n-    goods which have exceeded their expiry date without being sold;\r\n-    goods on commission;\r\n-    goods from sale on approval;\r\n-    sale or return goods;\r\n-    returnable transport or packaging containers;\r\n-    obsolete goods.\r\n\r\nThe announcement for returns may be used to return received goods for which receipt of delivery may already have been acknowledged by way of the Receiving Advice message (where this message is being used), e.g., the faulty goods are only discovered on opening a container for which a receiving advice has been issued.\r\n\r\nThe announcement for returns may also be used to specify additional information regarding the return of goods such as handling instructions or hazardous material information.\r\n\r\nThe recipient of the announcement for returns is requested to decide the final disposition of the goods for return:\r\n\r\n-    whether the goods shall be returned, repaired, destroyed, or disposed of;\r\n-    which transport means and mode should be used;\r\n-    on or by which date the return should take place;\r\n-    which party is responsible for the cost of return.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nAll specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd' /'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhere a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\n\r\nConditional data that is not required in the message should not be included.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.\r\n\r\nFree text information within the message should be avoided as this inhibits automatic processing. It is only used when additional information that cannot be accommodated within the other segments is required.

RETINS,2,Date:\r\n2001-05-15\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nD1 Materials Management (SWG)\r\n\r\n0. INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Instruction for returns message (RETINS) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message by which a party informs another party whether and how goods shall be returned.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Instruction for returns message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThe sender of an instruction for returns message will normally have previously been informed by the recipient of the intention to return goods by means of the Announcement for Returns message.\r\n\r\nThe instruction for returns message can be used to inform the receiving party on:\r\n\r\n- whether the goods shall be returned, repaired, destroyed, or disposed of;\r\n\r\n- which transport means and mode shall be used;\r\n\r\n- on or by which date the return shall take place;\r\n\r\n- which party is responsible for initialising transportation;\r\n\r\n- which party is responsible for the transportation costs;\r\n\r\n- any additional costs related to the return;\r\n\r\n- the carrier who shall carry out the transportation;\r\n\r\n- the address to which the returned goods should be sent;\r\n\r\n- any associated documents which will be raised in conjunction with the instruction for return, e.g. credit note.\r\n\r\n- fixed returns instructions for items which are returned on a scheduled basis, e.g. the collection of unsold newspapers will take place at a fixed time each week.\r\n\r\nThe instruction for returns may also be used to specify additional information regarding the return of goods such as handling instructions or hazardous material information.\r\n\r\nThe instruction for returns may be used to inform a party if the sender refuses, or does not require, return of the goods.\r\nIt must in this case indicate what action the message recipient should carry out (e.g. disposal, destroy).\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nAll specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd' / 'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).\r\n\r\nWhere a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\n\r\nConditional data that is not required in the message should not be included.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.\r\n\r\nFree text information within the message should be avoided as this inhibits automatic processing. It is only used when additional information that cannot be accommodated within the other segments is required.
SLSFCT~1~1,0,Senders unique message reference. Sequence numbers of messages in the interchange, DE 0062 in the UNT will have the same value. Generated by the sender.
SLSFCT~1~2~5,1,Indicates that the message is an EANCOM version 006 of the Sales Forecast.

SLSFCT~2~3,1,The message function, coded is a critical data element in this segment. It applies to all data indicated in the message. The following definitions apply for the restricted codes:\r\n1 = Cancellation - This code is used to cancel a previously sent Sales Forecast. Only the mandatory segments in the message need to be re-transmitted and at least two repetitions of the NAD segment identifying the sender and receiver of the message. A new Sales Forecast number and date of generation must be assigned to this message. The number and date of the previous Sales Forecast are to be specified in the RFF-DTM segment group (Group 03) at heading level.\r\n2 = Addition -This code is used to indicate the addition of sales for products which were omitted in error in the original transmission of the message. The original sales forecast number to which data is being added must be respecified in DE 1004 and only the added products need to be transmitted.\r\n5 = Replace - This code is used to cancel and replace a previously sent Sales Forecast with data transmitted in the current message. The Sales Forecast number in this segment will provide a new reference for the forecast replacing a previously transmission. The RFF-DTM segment group (Group 03) will refer to the Sales Forecast which is being cancelled.\r\n6 = Confirmation - This code is used to re-submit or re-send a copy of a previously sent Sales Forecast, for confirmation purposes. The Sales Forecast number and date will be the same as those used for the previous message being confirmed (DE 0062 in the UNH segment can be used to identify the last valid version of the message).\r\n9 = Original - An original transmission of a sales forecast report.
SLSFCT~2,4,This segment is used to indicate the type and function  of a message and to transmit the identifying number.\r\nAll references other than the document number DE 1004 are in the RFF segment (segment group 3).\r\nExample:\r\nBGM+72E::9+SDR1568+9'

INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Sales forecast message (SLSFCT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message to enable the transmission of forecast data related to products or services, such as corresponding location, period, product identification, pricing, monetary amount, quantity, market sector information, sales parties. It enables the recipient to process the information automatically and use it for production, planning, marketing, statistical purposes, etc.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Sales forecast message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThe message intent is to provide sales forecast information for one or more locations for a series of products within a specified time period.\r\n\r\nThe message is transmitted either from a seller to its supplier or from a headquarters, coordination or distribution centre to a manufacturer, supplier or a third party.\r\n\r\nIt allows the recipient to know sales forecast for a specific product by:\r\n\r\n- Sales location\r\n\r\n- Sales period\r\n\r\n- Product identification\r\n\r\n- Product selling price, quantity and value of the sales\r\n\r\n- Additional Identification of the products such as promotional flags, product group or family identification and internal identification numbers\r\n\r\n- Periodical Turnover of a specified location\r\n\r\n- Global specified product sales, i.e. total sales of a product in all locations\r\n\r\n- Sales channel, market segment end use, if known.\r\n\r\n- Sales parties identification, if known.\r\n\r\n- Outlet identification, if known.\r\n\r\nThough the message is location driven, it is conceivable that the recipient process the data to derive information based on other variables such as a specific product and all its related sales locations and/or addresses or forecasted periodic turnover and the related locations.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nAll specified dates/times should be in the format 'yymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhere a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\n\r\nConditional data that is not required in the message should not be included.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.\r\n\r\nFree text information within the message should be avoided as this inhibits automatic processing.

SLSRPT~28,5,If Global Trade Item Numbers are available it is mandatory to use GTIN within the LIN segment.
SLSRPT~29~1,1,Product Id function has the following restricted coded function:\r\n1 - Additional Identification - To provide an additional identity for the product identified in the LIN segment. The additional identification can consist of:\r\nA supplemental identification which provides more information complementary to the main GTIN provided in the LIN segment, e.g., a batch number, promotional variant number, product group number, etc.\r\nAn alternative identification which may be used instead of the main GTIN provided in the LIN segment, e.g., a buyers article number, an HIBC code, etc.\r\n5 - Product Identification  - To provide the primary product identification code when no GTIN has been provided in the LIN segment.
SLSRPT~29,4,This segment is used to specify additional item identification codes such as a buyers, or sellers, item number.\r\nExample:\r\nPIA+1+AEX5421:IN'\r\nIn this example the PIA segment is used to provide an additional identification to the GTIN provided in the LIN segment.

SLSRPT,2,Date:\r\n2001-05-15\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nD2 Purchasing (SWG)\r\n\r\n0. INTRODUCTION\r\nThis specification provides the definition of the Sales data report message (SLSRPT) to be used in Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in administration, commerce and transport.\r\n\r\n1. SCOPE\r\n\r\n1.1 Functional definition\r\nA message to enable the conveyance of product activity related to the sale of products or services, such as the activity location, date, time or period, quantity, pricing, monetary amount, market sector, involved parties and other data enabling various sales analysis processes. Such activity information allows the recipient to perform statistical and quantitative analysis in support of production, planning, marketing, replenishment, and other processes.\r\n\r\n1.2 Field of application\r\nThe Sales data report message may be used for both national and international applications. It is based on universal practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and is not dependent on the type of business or industry.\r\n\r\n1.3 Principles\r\nThis message provides product activity related to the sale of products or services in two mutually exclusive methods. These two methods are represented by segment groups 5 and 10 within the detail area.\r\n- The first method is reporting activity by line item within a specific location, e.g. reporting each product sold within a specific location. This method will utilise segment group 5 and its subordinate groups. If segment group 5 is used segment group 10 shall not be used.\r\n- The second method is reporting activity by location within each line item, e.g. reporting each location and quantity sold for a particular product. This method will utilise segment group 10 and its subordinate groups. If segment group 10 is used segment group 5 shall not be used.\r\n\r\nThe message may be sent from a buyer, seller, distributor, public warehouse or third party to their supplier, distributor, manufacturer, or other third party. It is assumed the recipient will perform analytical processing of the data in support of other business processes such as marketing, replenishment, or product development.\r\n\r\nThis message provides the recipient with detailed information relative to a specific product such as:\r\n\r\n- Location of the activity, e.g. sale or product movement.\r\n- Specific parties involved, e.g. name of company sold to.\r\n- Date or period of the activity.\r\n- Activity price, e.g. selling price.\r\n- Activity quantity, e.g. quantity sold.\r\n- Promotion in effect.\r\n- Value of the sales.\r\n- Periodical turnover.\r\n- Additional product information, e.g. product groups or id numbers.\r\n- Identification of market segment or channel of distribution.\r\n- Summarisation of information for various locations, e.g.\r\nsales for all locations in a region.\r\n\r\n2. REFERENCES\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 1.\r\n\r\n3. TERMS AND DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n3.1 Standard terms and definitions\r\nSee UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General Introduction, Section 2.\r\n\r\n4. MESSAGE DEFINITION\r\n\r\n4.1 Data segment clarification\r\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the segment table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating requirements.\r\n\r\nThe following guidelines and principles apply to the whole message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the message:\r\n\r\nAll specified dates/times should be in the format 'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole numbers representing the required period as indicated in the format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.).\r\n\r\nWhere a choice of code or text is given only the code element should be used wherever possible.\r\nDue to the high volume of data that will be usually transmitted in the Sales Data Report message, it is highly recommended to use codes for products and locations.\r\n\r\nConditional data that is not required in the message should not be included.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the trigger segment of a group.
