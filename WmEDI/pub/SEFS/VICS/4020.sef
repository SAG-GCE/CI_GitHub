180~24~4,0,Clarification of reason code in RDR02 or RDR03
180~25,4,There is one segment for each Allowance, Charge, Service, or Promotion being specified. If this segment appears in the header area of the transaction set, the data applies to the entire transaction set. If this segment appears in the detail area of the transaction set, the data applies only to that line item. The data specified in the header area is exclusive of the data specified in the detail area; it is not the sum of the data in the detail area, i.e., allowances or charges.\r\n\r\nSAC04 contains special service requirement codes and special processing codes. This code list is maintained by the VICS EDI SMC and is located in Section III of this guideline.
180~25~10,0,When SAC02 contains code D170, this data element is required and will contain the quantity of free goods. The unit of measure is in SAC09.\r\n\r\nSAC10 alone is used to indicate a specific quantity which could be a dollar amount, that is applicable to the service, promotion, allowance, or charge.
180~25~12~01~1~0,0,The allowance or charge amount will be adjudicated as a separate item, i.e., a debit/credit memo or a separate invoice. The amount will not be reflected in the invoice total amount.
180~25~12~02~1~0,0,The allowance or charge amount will be reflected in the total transaction amount, e.g., Total Invoice Amount = Merchandise Price + Charges - Allowances.

The data specified in the header area is exclusive of the data specified in the detail area; it is not the sum of the data in the detail area, i.e., allowances or charges.\r\n\r\nSAC04 contains special service requirement codes and special processing codes. This code list is maintained by the VICS EDI SMC and is located in Section III of this guideline.
180~8~10,0,When SAC02 contains code D170, this data element is required and will contain the quantity of free goods. The unit of measure is in SAC09.\r\n\r\nSAC10 alone is used to indicate a specific quantity which could be a dollar amount, that is applicable to the service, promotion, allowance, or charge.

810~15,4,See Section V (ITD Terms Specification and Formulas) for usage examples.\r\n\r\nIn the transitional period for the retail industry, from paper to full automated EDI transactions, there may be a perceived need to send text data with the terms. Clearly the goal is to have the entire retail industry participating in EDI. Therefore, if text data is needed to be sent for terms, ITD12 will contain the free form text. If additional text is needed, additional ITD segments will be used.\r\n\r\nMany times, deferred terms are specified on the purchase order with only the knowledge that the terms are to be based on a date value which is not known, e.g., invoice or delivery date. What is known is the percentage or dollar amount of each deferred installment, and the number of days after the date the terms are based on, that each installment will be due. In these cases, ITD01 will contain code 04, indicating deferred or installment terms, and ITD02 will contain the appropriate terms date basis code (most typically code 2 for Delivery Date, code 3 for Invoice Date, or code 15 for Receipt of Goods Date). ITD07 will contain the number of days after the terms basis date that this installment is due. ITD10 or ITD11 will be used to indicate a dollar amount (ITD10) for that installment or the percent (ITD11) for that installment. Use one ITD segment for each installment. When specifying deferred terms and the exact terms basis date is known, e.g., invoice date, ITD09 should be used to specify the exact deferred or installment date.

810~8,4,BASIC There will be at least one occurrence of the N1 segment to specify the buying party by using code BY in N101. It is assumed that, for a particular buying location, the retailer has the ship to and bill to in their system, therefore, it need not be sent. Use the ship to if there are multiple ship-to locations for the buying location. SPREADSHEET The SDQ segment is used to specify the retailer's buying locations. Therefore, code BY is not used in the N1 segment for the spreadsheet invoice. It is assumed the retailer has the bill to and ship to for all of the retailer's buying locations. Therefore, this segment is normally not used. If either the bill-to or ship-to locations are to be overridden, this segment is used to specify those locations. CAUTION, this will override every bill to or ship to for every buying location in the SDQ segment.\r\n\r\nN103 and N104 are required except when N101 contains code CC, CT, DL, OW, or RE.\r\n\r\nWhen the ship to is the end consumer (customer of retailer), N103 and N104 are not required.;\r\n\r\nIn some EDI implementations, it may be necessary to identify the sender and/or receiver of the transaction set within each transaction set. To identify the sender of the transaction set, N101 will contain code FR. To identify the receiver of the transaction set, N101 will contain code TO.\r\n\r\nN106 is used to indicate the remit-to party is a factor. N106 can be used only when N101 contains code RI.

The value assigned to the first HL segment will be 1, and is incremented by one for each subsequent HL segment within the transaction set.\r\n\r\nHL02 identifies the hierarchical ID of the HL segment to which it is subordinate (child of). HL02 will be omitted for the first occurrence of the HL segment in the transaction set, since it has no parent. HL03 identifies the application context of the series of segments following the current HL segment up to the next occurrence of an HL segment, or the SE segment.\r\n\r\nThe HL segment defines a top-down/left-right ordered structure. Therefore, there shall be only one occurrence of the Company or Supergroup level within a given transaction set.\r\n\r\nThe value of HL03 will be determined by the code in BHT01. If BHT01 contains code 0055, the HL03 shall contain code 26. If BHT01 contains code 0057 or 0065, then this level of detail is not used in the transaction set.

824~16~1,0,This data element is used to specify the type of error condition detected.
824~16~2,0,The majority of specific application edits will involve a single data element. In this situation, the generic error condition detected is specified in TED01, and the name of the data element in error is specified in TED02. For example, if the department number is invalid, TED01 would contain code 024 and TED02 would contain "Invalid Department Number". If however, the specific application edit involves more than one data element, this data element describes the error condition, and the applicable data elements. For example, if an application edit detected retail price was not greater than cost price, TED01 would contain code 012 and this data element would contain "Retail price is not greater than cost price". If more than 60 characters are required to describe the error condition, the first 60 characters appear in this data element, and the remaining error description characters appear in NTE02. For example, TED01 contains code 010, TED02 contains "Sum of SKU cost extensions does not equal total invoice", and NTE02 contains "quantity.".
824~17,4,This segment is only generated when an error description contains more than 60 characters of data. For example, if 95 characters are required to describe the error condition, the first 60 characters appear in TED02, and the remaining 35 characters are sent in NTE02.

Both quantities may be specified within the same transaction set or a separate transaction set may be used for each forecast type. The forecast is assumed to be a demand forecast unless specifically identified as a consumer sales forecast. When using separate transaction sets, FST10 is not used and BFR12 will indicate if the forecast is for consumer sales. When using one transaction set for both, BFR12 is not used and FST10 will indicate when the quantities are forecasted consumer sales.
830~23,4,The SDQ segment specifies the retailer's reporting location. Therefore, code RL is not used in the N1 segment for the forecasting transaction set when the SDQ segment is used, i.e., the N1 and SDQ segments are mutually exclusive for specifying reporting locations.\r\n\r\nLocation is trading partner defined, e.g., store, distribution center, region, etc.\r\n\r\nIn some EDI implementations, it may be necessary to identify the sender and/or receiver of the transaction set within each transaction set. To identify the sender of the transaction set, N101 will contain code FR. To identify the receiver of the transaction set, N101 will contain code TO.

832~2,4,BCT10 is used only to clarify, to the receiver, the sender's purpose of the transaction set. Code 13 is used to request catalog information from the owner of the catalog or the authorized agent, e.g., a third party catalog service. Code 11 is used only when the transaction set is a reply to a specific request transaction. If the sender has a standing request from the receiver for specific data when a specific event takes place, e.g., women's tops, new products, every two weeks, this is NOT considered a response. The recipient will only receive a response (BCT10 contains code 11) if the recipient had previously sent a request (BCT10 contains code 13). Codes 02, 03, 04, and 05 are to be used to update catalog information kept by the user of the catalog data, e.g., a retailer or the vendor's agent.\r\n\r\nIf BCT10 contains code 00, a mix of adds, changes and deletes is assumed. The G53 segment, in the detail area, specifies the action to be taken.\r\n\r\nData may be requested or access may be granted to the entire catalog or a portion of it without regard to any specific SKU(s). When requesting or granting catalog access for the entire catalog, BCT03 is not used. BCT10 will contain code 13 for requests or code 02 or 03 for access control and the detail area (LIN loop) is not used. The same procedure is used to request data or grant access to a portion of the catalog by adding BCT03 with the appropriate selection code for the portion of the catalog needed.\r\n\r\nCaution must be exercised when deleting a U.P.C. from the catalog. Due to ordering and shipping cycle times, a U.P.C. should reside on the catalog as discontinued at least one year after the last of the product has been shipped. Deleting the U.P.C. from the catalog does not alter the minimum retention period (30 months for apparel and 48 months for all other items) as defined in the U.P.C. Data Communications Guidelines for General Merchandise and Apparel.

832~61,4,See Section V (ITD Terms Specification and Formulas) for usage examples.\r\n\r\nIn the transitional period for the retail industry, from paper to full automated EDI transactions, there may be a perceived need to send text data with the terms. Clearly the goal is to have the entire retail industry participating in EDI. Therefore, if text data is needed to be sent for terms, ITD12 will contain the free form text. If additional text is needed, additional ITD segments will be used.
832~61~11,0,The percent is sent with a decimal point only when needed, e.g., 10.5% is sent as "10.5", and 2% is sent as "2".
832~61~2~7~1~0,0,The date is specified in the DTM segment in the header area using code 007 in DTM01.

832~63,4,There is one segment for each Allowance, Charge, Service, or Promotion being specified. If this segment appears in the header area of the transaction set, the data applies to the entire transaction set. If this segment appears in the detail area of the transaction set, the data applies only to that line item. The data specified in the header area is exclusive of the data specified in the detail area; it is not the sum of the data in the detail area, i.e., allowances or charges.
832~63~12~02~1~0,0,The allowance or charge amount will be reflected in the total transaction amount, e.g., Total Invoice Amount = Merchandise Price + Charges - Allowances.
832~63~12~06~1~0,0,When the order/item is a direct ship to the customer, or end consumer of the retailer, the allowance or charge amount is the responsibility of the customer or end consumer. If it is not a drop ship to the customer of the retailer, then the allowance or charge amount is the responsibility of the retailer. The exact method of adjudication has been agreed to by the trading partners. The amount will not be reflected in the total invoice amount.

832~69,4,This segment should be used to provide physical characteristics relative to a consumer selling unit.\r\n\r\nWhen changing a U.P.C. Consumer Package Code, the new code is identified in LIN02/LIN03 and G5501/G5502 and the replaced U.P.C. Consumer Package Code is indicated in G5529/G5530.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the consumer unit may be specified by using G5505 through G5510.\r\n\r\nG5506, G5508 and G5510 must be in the same unit or basis for measurement code.\r\n\r\nThis segment is used to specify the packaging of the item in the case or carton. There may be two levels of packaging specified. The first level is always specified by using G5513 (Pack). The first level may be actual items, e.g., consumer units, or it may be the number of smaller containers within the case. The second level, specified using G5532 (Inner Pack), is the number of eaches in each inner container when G5513 is the number of smaller containers within the case. See Section V (Pack/Inner Pack Usage) for usage examples.\r\n\r\nG5514 and G5515 should be used only if different from G3918 and G3919.\r\n\r\nThis segment may be used to specify the weight of the consumer unit by using G5523, G5524, and G5525. The volume (cube) of the consumer unit may be specified by using G5511 and G5512.\r\n\r\nThis segment can be used also to specify the type of packaging for the consumer unit by using G5533.\r\n\r\nThe codes listed for G5501 apply to both occurrences of Data Element 235 in the G55 segment.\r\n\r\nSee Section III for complete U.P.C. and EAN code definitions.

The volume (cube) of the vendor selling unit may be specified by using G3914 and G3915.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the vendor selling unit may be specified by using G3908 through G3913.\r\n\r\nThis segment is used to specify the packaging of the item in the case or carton. There may be two levels of packaging specified. The first level is always specified by using G3917 (Pack). The first level may be actual items, e.g., consumer units, or it may be the number of smaller containers within the case. The second level, specified using G3927 (Inner Pack), is the number of eaches in each inner container when G3917 is the number smaller containers within the case. See Section V (Pack/Inner Pack Usage) for usage examples.\r\n\r\nThis segment can be used also to specify the type of packaging for the vendor selling unit by using G3928.\r\n\r\nThe codes listed for G3902 apply to both occurrences of Data Element 235 in the G39 segment.\r\n\r\nSee Section III for complete U.P.C. and EAN code definitions.

Clearly the goal is to have the entire retail industry participating in EDI. Therefore, if text data is needed to be sent for terms, ITD12 will contain the free form text. If additional text is needed, additional ITD segments will be used.\r\n\r\nMany times, deferred terms are specified on the purchase order with only the knowledge that the terms are to be based on a date value which is not known, e.g., invoice or delivery date. What is known is the percentage or dollar amount of each deferred installment, and the number of days after the date the terms are based on, that each installment will be due. In these cases, ITD01 will contain code 04, indicating deferred or installment terms, and ITD02 will contain the appropriate terms date basis code (most typically code 2 for Delivery Date, code 3 for Invoice Date, or code 15 for Receipt of Goods Date). ITD07 will contain the number of days after the terms basis date that this installment is due. ITD10 or ITD11 will be used to indicate a dollar amount (ITD10) for that installment or the percent (ITD11) for that installment. Use one ITD segment for each installment. When specifying deferred terms and the exact terms basis date is known, e.g., invoice date, ITD09 should be used to specify the exact deferred or installment date.
850~104~11,0,The percent is sent with a decimal point only when needed, e.g., 10.5% is sent as "10.5", and 2% is sent as "2".

850~109,4,This segment is used to distribute the line item quantity to various locations. SDQ02 serves the same purpose as N103, and all occurrences of Data Element 67, in this segment, function as N104. The SDQ segment functions as an N1 segment containing code BY in N101, that is, the SDQ segment specifies various buying locations. The N1 segment, in the basic order, specifies only one location. The sum of all quantities in the SDQ segment(s), for a line item, must equal the quantity ordered in PO102.

850~11,4,This segment may be used in the header area or the detail area, but not both.
850~12,4,There is one segment for each Allowance, Charge, Service, or Promotion being specified. If this segment appears in the header area of the transaction set, the data applies to the entire transaction set. If this segment appears in the detail area of the transaction set, the data applies only to that line item. The data specified in the header area is exclusive of the data specified in the detail area; it is not the sum of the data in the detail area, i.e., allowances or charges.\r\n\r\nSAC04 contains special service requirement codes and special processing codes. This code list is maintained by the VICS EDI SMC and is located in Section III of this guideline.
850~12~10,0,When SAC02 contains code D170, this data element is required and will contain the quantity of free goods. The unit of measure is in SAC09.\r\n\r\nSAC10 alone is used to indicate a specific quantity which could be a dollar amount, that is applicable to the service, promotion, allowance, or charge.
850~12~12~01~1~0,0,The allowance or charge amount will be adjudicated as a separate item, i.e., a debit/credit memo or a separate invoice. The amount will not be reflected in the invoice total amount.

850~12~12~06~1~0,0,When the order/item is a direct ship to the customer, or end consumer of the retailer, the allowance or charge amount is the responsibility of the customer or end consumer. If it is not a drop ship to the customer of the retailer, then the allowance or charge amount is the responsibility of the retailer. The exact method of adjudication has been agreed to by the trading partners. The amount will not be reflected in the total invoice amount.

850~25,4,This segment is used to specify every carrier in the routing sequence or a specific routing sequence that has been previously identified (usually from a routing guide). The segment can also be used to indicate estimated transit time in days. Only use TD501 if needed for clarity; this is not a requirement in most retail applications. When referring to a pre-established routing guide, use code 91 or 92 in TD502, and identify the routing sequence, from the routing guide, in TD503. To identify a specific private parcel service, TD502 will contain code 2, and TD503 will contain the corresponding SCAC. TD510 and TD511 are used to specify transit time.

850~47,4,This segment is used to identify the retailer's location as it pertains to the order. Every purchase order must contain the identity of the buying party (purchaser). This is accomplished in one of two ways depending on the type of purchase order, Basic or Spreadsheet. BASIC There will be at least one occurrence of the N1 segment to specify the buying party by using code BY in N101. It is assumed that, for a particular buying location, the vendor has the ship to and bill to in their system, therefore, it need not be sent. Use the ship to if there are multiple ship-to locations for the buying location. SPREADSHEET The SDQ segment specifies the retailer's buying locations. Therefore, code BY is not used in the N1 segment for the spreadsheet purchase order. It is assumed the vendor has the bill to and ship to for all of the retailer's buying locations. Therefore, this segment is normally not used. If either the bill-to or ship-to locations are to be overridden, this segment is used to specify those locations. Only one iteration of each of the bill to or ship to overrides is allowed. CAUTION, this will override every bill to or ship to for every buying location in the SDQ segment(s). For example, when the customer is instructing the supplier to package goods for cross-docking, one iteration of the N1 segment, with N101 containing code ST, may be used to indicate the ship-to location. The ship-to location overrides the ship-to locations that are normally associated with the buying parties identified in the SDQ segment(s).\r\n\r\nN103 and N104 are required except when N101 contains code CT, MA or OB.\r\n\r\nWhen the ship to is the end consumer (customer of retailer), N103 and N104 are not required.;\r\n\r\nIn some EDI implementations, it may be necessary to identify the sender and/or receiver of the transaction set within each transaction set. To identify the sender of the transaction set, N101 will contain code FR. To identify the receiver of the transaction set, N101 will contain code TO.

850~83,4,The multi-SKU case pack is used by retailers to order cases packed with specific items, each with a specific quantity. This is similar to the dynamic assortment, however, the unit of measurement code in PO103 is different for each use. For dynamic assortments, PO103 will contain code AS. This identifies the item listed in the Product/Service IDs as an assortment and the contents of the assortment are listed in subsequent SLN segments. For assortments, at least one occurrence of the Product/Service ID Qualifier and the Product/Service ID are required to identify the assortment. This may be a U.P.C., a vendor assigned number, or a retailer assigned number. There is no implication of packaging for assortments; this is part of the trading partners' business practices. Assortments are primarily used as an ordering tool. For the multi-SKU case pack, PO103 will contain code CA, and there is no requirement to send a Product/Service ID in the PO1 segment. The use of code CA in PO103, and the presence of the SLN segments, informs the receiver to pack the cases with the SKUs and quantities in the SLN segments. The quantity in PO102 is the number of cases being ordered. Each SLN segment, that follows the PO1 segment, lists the Product ID, e.g., U.P.C., and the quantity of the SKU that is to be in the case. The total units in each case is the sum of the quantities in the SLN segment.\r\n\r\nThe codes listed for PO106 apply to every occurrence of Data Element 235 in the PO1 segment.\r\n\r\nSee Section III for complete U.P.C. and EAN code definitions.
850~83~3,0,See Section III for code list.

850~95,4,This segment is used primarily by an importer to communicate document requirements to the vendor. The vendor must deliver the required documents to the shipping agent to obtain a cargo receipt. The cargo receipt is then used to obtain payment for the purchase order.
850~96,4,This segment is used to specify the packaging of the item in the case or carton. There may be two levels of packaging specified. The first level is always specified by using PO401 (Pack). The first level may be actual items, e.g., consumer units, or it may be the number of smaller containers within the case. The second level, specified using PO414 (Inner Pack), is the number of eaches in each inner container when PO401 is the number of smaller containers within the case. See Section V (Pack/Inner Pack Usage) for usage examples.\r\n\r\nThis segment can be used also to specify the weight and/or volume (cube) for the item by using PO406 and PO407, and/or PO408 and PO409.

852~16,4,The prices specified in this segment, in the LIN loop, apply to all quantities in the ZA or SDQ segments.\r\n\r\nThis segment is used to report prices associated with the item and activity. It is not used to report total dollar values. This segment can also be used to further define quantity sold/quantity on order within the associated ZA loop by sales type (i.e., promotion/event sales, clearance/markdown sales, non-promotion/non-markdown sales).
852~16~2~CDV~1~0,0,Retail price of last item sold during the reporting period (last selling price)

852~18,4,This segment is used to specify the packaging of the item in the case or carton. There may be two levels of packaging specified. The first level is always specified by using PO401 (Pack). The first level may be actual items, e.g., consumer units, or it may be the number of smaller containers within the case. The second level, specified using PO414 (Inner Pack), is the number of eaches in each inner container when PO401 is the number of smaller containers within the case. See Section V (Pack/Inner Pack Usage) for usage examples.\r\n\r\nThis segment can be used also to specify the weight and/or volume (cube) for the item by using PO406 and PO407, and/or PO408 and PO409.

852~23,4,If ZA02 and ZA03 are used to specify the quantity of the item identified in the LIN segment, the SDQ segment is not used.\r\n\r\nAll quantity values (ZA03 or quantity values in the SDQ segment) are expressed as a positive number for all activities except for adjustments (code QA and QT in ZA01). An adjustment is any activity, other than a retail sale or warehouse withdrawal, that changes the inventory position for the item. Inter-store transfers are reported as a positive adjustment for the transfer-to store and a negative adjustment for the transfer-from store. An adjustment to inventory can also be made as a result of a physical inventory, for example, shrinkage is reported as a negative adjustment, understated inventory is reported as a positive adjustment.\r\n\r\nTo express activity in dollars, use the unit of measure DO (Dollars, U.S.) in ZA03 or SDQ01. Multiple ZA segments may be used with the same activity code to specify units and dollars, and, to report activity at different prices. Sales types, promotion/event sales, clearance/markdown sales and non-promotion/non-clearance sales are used in conjunction with a CTP segment to specify the price and/or sales type. For example, if three stores sold an item for one price and five other stores sold the same item for a different price, two ZA loops may be used to report the sale quantity at the appropriate price. The first ZA loop would contain the price in the CTP segment and one SDQ segment with the three stores/quantities. The second loop would specify the other price and one SDQ segment for the remaining five stores/quantities.

852~5,4,This segment is used only when contacts have not been previously established or a unique situation exists.
852~6,4,This segment is used to identify the retailer's location as it pertains to product activity data and must contain the identity of each organizational entity or a physical location. This is accomplished in one of two ways: BASIC There will be at least one occurrence of this segment that specifies the retailers buying/reporting location. If XQ01 contains code G, it is assumed that, for a particular buying location, the vendor has the bill to and ship to in the system. SPREADSHEET The SDQ segment specifies the retailer's buying/reporting locations. Therefore, codes BY and RL are not used in the N1 segment for the spreadsheet product activity.\r\n\r\nIn some EDI implementations, it may be necessary to identify the sender and/or receiver of the transaction set within each transaction set. To identify the sender of the transaction set, N101 will contain code FR. To identify the receiver of the transaction set, N101 will contain code TO.

853~4,4,This segment is required for VICS EDI usage. The routing guide information supplied in this transaction will be effective for all shipments which occur on or after the stated effective date.
853~5,4,A routing guide defines shipping instructions from one point to another. This is called an origin and destination pair. There must be two iterations of the N1 segment to establish the origin (ship from)/destination (ship to) pair. The ship from always represents the seller's shipping facility and the ship to always represents the buyer's receiving facility. This pair does not represent the third parties to the movement of the goods.\r\n\r\nThe identification code qualifier and identification code (N103 and N104), should be the same codes that would appear on an electronic purchase order or ship notice/manifest to identify the ship to. This transaction is not a replacement for the name and address function of Transaction Set 864, but rather a supplement to Transaction Set 864 or its equivalent.
853~5~1~ST~1~0,0,Buyer's receiving facility
853~5~4,0,This is the location code as defined by N103. The location code may be a formal number, e.g., DUNS, or it may be assigned by either the buyer or seller.

855~11~12~05~1~0,0,The vendor is responsible for the allowance or charge amount. The exact method of adjudication has been agreed to by the trading partners. The amount will not be reflected in the total invoice amount.
855~11~12~06~1~0,0,When the order/item is a direct ship to the customer, or end consumer of the retailer, the allowance or charge amount is the responsibility of the customer or end consumer. If it is not a drop ship to the customer of the retailer, then the allowance or charge amount is the responsibility of the retailer. The exact method of adjudication has been agreed to by the trading partners. The amount will not be reflected in the total invoice amount.
855~11~2,0,See Section III for code list.
855~11~4,0,See Section III for code list.

855~13,4,See Section V (ITD Terms Specification and Formulas) for usage examples.\r\n\r\nIn the transitional period for the retail industry, from paper to full automated EDI transactions, there may be a perceived need to send text data with the terms. Clearly the goal is to have the entire retail industry participating in EDI. Therefore, if text data is needed to be sent for terms, ITD12 will contain the free form text. If additional text is needed, additional ITD segments will be used.\r\n\r\nThis segment is used only to modify previouly agreed upon terms of sale with consent of both parties.\r\n\r\nThis segment is used only by the alcohol beverage industry.

855~36,4,The SDQ segment specifies the retailer's buying locations. Therefore, code BY is not used in the N1 segment for the spreadsheet purchase order. It is assumed the supplier has the bill-to and ship-to data for all of the retailer's buying locations. Therefore, this segment is normally not used. If either the bill-to or ship-to locations are to be overridden, this segment is used to specify those locations. CAUTION, this will override every bill to or ship to for every buying location in the SDQ segments.\r\n\r\nN103 and N104 are required except when N101 contains code MA or OB.\r\n\r\nIn some EDI implementations, it may be necessary to identify the sender and/or receiver of the transaction set within each transaction set.

855~69,4,There is one segment for each Allowance, Charge, Service, or Promotion being specified. If this segment appears in the header area of the transaction set, the data applies to the entire transaction set. If this segment appears in the detail area of the transaction set, the data applies only to that line item. The data specified in the header area is exclusive of the data specified in the detail area; it is not the sum of the data in the detail area, i.e., allowances or charges.\r\n\r\nSAC04 contains special service requirement codes and special processing codes. This code list is maintained by the VICS EDI SMC and is located in Section III of this guideline.
855~69~10,0,When SAC02 contains code D170, this data element is required and will contain the quantity of free goods. The unit of measure is in SAC09.\r\n\r\nSAC10 alone is used to indicate a specific quantity which could be a dollar amount, that is applicable to the service, promotion, allowance, or charge.
855~69~12~01~1~0,0,The allowance or charge amount will be adjudicated as a separate item, i.e., a debit/credit memo or a separate invoice. The amount will not be reflected in the invoice total amount.
855~69~12~02~1~0,0,The allowance or charge amount will be reflected in the total transaction amount, e.g., Total Invoice Amount = Merchandise Price + Charges - Allowances.
855~69~12~03~1~0,0,The vendor will issue a check directly to the customer of the retailer, or end consumer, for the allowance or charge amount. The amount is not reflected in the total invoice amount.

855~69~12~05~1~0,0,The vendor is responsible for the allowance or charge amount. The exact method of adjudication has been agreed to by the trading partners. The amount will not be reflected in the total invoice amount.
855~69~12~06~1~0,0,When the order/item is a direct ship to the customer, or end consumer of the retailer, the allowance or charge amount is the responsibility of the customer or end consumer. If it is not a drop ship to the customer of the retailer, then the allowance or charge amount is the responsibility of the retailer. The exact method of adjudication has been agreed to by the trading partners. The amount will not be reflected in the total invoice amount.

856~220,4,The HL segment is used to identify levels of detail information using a hierarchical structure.\r\n\r\nHL01 shall contain a unique number for each occurrence of the HL segment within the transaction set. The value assigned to the first HL segment will be 1, and is incremented by one for each subsequent HL segment within the transaction set.\r\n\r\nHL02 identifies the hierarchical ID of the HL segment to which it is subordinate (child of). HL02 will be omitted for the first occurrence of the HL segment in the transaction set, since it has no parent. HL03 identifies the application content of the series of segments following the current HL segment up to the next occurrence of an HL segment, or the CTT or SE segment, e.g., Shipment, Unit Load, Order, Tare, Pack and Item.
856~221,4,This segment, at the pack level, is used to specify the U.P.C. Case Code or the U.P.C./EAN Shipping Container Code (SCC-14), and production information. The SN1 segment that follows is used to specify the number of cases identified in the LIN segment. The LIN segment, at the item level, is used to indicate the individual consumer units for the case code.\r\n\r\nThe codes listed for LIN02 apply to every occurrence of Data Element 235 in the LIN segment.
856~222,4,This segment, at the pack level, is used only to specify the number of cases identified by the U.P.C./EAN Case Code or the U.P.C./EAN Shipping Container Code (SCC-14) in the previous LIN segment. The LIN segment in the item level is used to indicate the individual consumer units for the case code.
856~223,4,This segment, when used in a standard carton pack structure at the pack level, may only be used to specify an individual component of the item identified in the LIN segment in the previous item level. The quantity specified in SN102, at the item level, represents the number of sets, and SN103 will contain code ST, to identify it as a set. Each subsequent MAN segment, within this pack level, identifies the carton ID for each component identified in the SLN segment. Additional pack level SLN segments and MAN segments are used to represent each different component of the SKU.\r\n\r\nThe codes listed for SLN09 apply to every occurrence of Data Element 235 in the SLN segment.\r\n\r\nSee Section III for complete U.P.C. and EAN code definitions.

856~225,4,In a pick and pack structure, this segment, at the pack level, is used only to specify the carton weight and/or physical dimensions.\r\n\r\nThis segment may be used to describe a master pack of an item or a master pack of a component of an item in a standard carton pack structure.\r\n\r\nA master pack of an item is where multiple units of an item, identified in the LIN segment at the item level, are physically packed within a shipping container, such as four crockpots to a shipping container. The item and total quantity are identified in the LIN segment at the item level. The PO4 segment, at the pack level, is used to identify the master pack makeup. PO401 (Pack) is the number of containers packed within the container identified at the pack level, the master pack. PO414 (Inner Pack) is the number of items packed within each container indicated in PO401. For example, if the manufacturer is shipping eight crockpots in one master pack, with each master pack containing four boxes, each box containing two crockpots, the item level would indicate the U.P.C. for the crockpots, with a quantity of eight each. The pack level would contain a PO4 segment with PO401 equal to 4 and PO414 equal to 2.\r\n\r\nA master pack of a component of an item is similar to the master pack of an item with the exception that the component is identified in the SLN segment at the pack level and the item is identified at the item level. The SLN segment is used to identify how many of this component are in the item. The PO4 segment specifies how many of these components are in the shipping container identified at the pack level. For example, 8 lamps are being shipped. Each lamp has two components, the lamp base and lamp shade, and each lamp base is shipped one to a container and shades are shipped four to a container. The LIN segment at the item level would contain the U.P.C. for the lamp, with a quantity of 8 and a unit of measure of ST for set. There would be one pack level for each component.\r\n\r\nFor the shade component, the SLN segment would identify the shade and a quantity of 1, and PO401 would equal 4. PO414 is not needed since inner packs are not present. There would be two MAN segments to identify each of the two cartons which contain four lamp shades each.\r\n\r\nFor the base component, the SLN segment would identify the base and a quantity of 1. The PO4 segment is not used. There would be eight MAN segments to identify each carton containing one lamp base.

856~251,4,When the shipping container is the same as the consumer unit, the U.P.C. may be the only UCC identification code on the container. In many applications, it is necessary to positively identify what identification code is to be scanned and matched at point of receipt. Since the U.P.C. is not a unique serial shipping container code, only one pack level for each item is required when using the pick and pack structure. The total number of shipping units for this item is the same as the quantity for the item in the SN1 segment at the item level.
856~251~1~AA~1~0,0,This is an eighteen-character UCC/EAN-128 Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC-18) that does not include the two digit application identifier, the symbology code, or the modulo 103 check character.

856~274,4,The HL segment is used to identify levels of detail information using a hierarchical structure.\r\n\r\nHL01 shall contain a unique number for each occurrence of the HL segment within the transaction set. The value assigned to the first HL segment will be 1, and is incremented by one for each subsequent HL segment within the transaction set.\r\n\r\nHL02 identifies the hierarchical ID of the HL segment to which it is subordinate (child of). HL02 will be omitted for the first occurrence of the HL segment in the transaction set, since it has no parent. HL03 identifies the application content of the series of segments following the current HL segment up to the next occurrence of an HL segment, or the CTT or SE segment, e.g., Shipment, Unit Load, Order, Tare, Pack and Item.

856~276,4,This segment is used to specify the quantities associated with the item identified in the LIN at the item level.\r\n\r\nWhen specifying an item, which is comprised of two or more components that are in unique shipping containers, SN103 will contain code ST for set and the quantity specified in SN102 is the number of sets as identified in the LIN segment. Each different component is identified in one pack level. See the VICS Note, on the SLN segment, at the pack level.
856~276~3,0,See Section III for code list.
856~276~6,0,See Section III for code list.
856~277,4,This segment can be used to specify the originally ordered SKU for substituted SKUs. This segment can also be used to specify SKU contents of an assortment. The assortment can be defined by the retailer or the vendor. The assortment identification is in the line item detail segment for the transaction. This segment may be used to specify partial deletions of SKUs ordered but not invoiced and/or shipped. This segment may also be used to specify export item detail, such as price information, when shipments are made across the border.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the ASC X12 Ship Notice/Manifest does not have the same capability as the Purchase Order and Invoice for specification of the price placed on pre-ticketed items. For many retailers, this information is necessary to determine if the cartons need to be routed to areas for re-ticketing for promotional pricing. The SLN can function, in a limited way, to satisfy this need. SLN03 will contain code I, SLN04 will contain the same code value as SN102, SLN05 will be the same as SN103, SLN06 will be the price on the ticket and SLN07 will contain code RE.\r\n\r\nIf SLN03 contains code D or code I, then SLN04 and SLN05 are required.\r\n\r\nThe codes listed for SLN09 apply to every occurrence of Data Element 235 in the SLN segment.\r\n\r\nSee Section III for complete U.P.C. and EAN code definitions.
856~277~5~1,0,See Section III for code list.
856~277~6,0,The price is sent with a decimal point only when needed, e.g., $15.95 would be sent as "15.95", and $29.00 would be sent as "29".\r\n\r\nTo indicate a no charge item or free goods, SLN06 will contain a single zero (0) and SLN07 will contain code NC.
856~277~7,0,This data element is used to clarify or alter the basis of unit price. The unit price expressed in SLN06 is always in the same terms as the unit of measure in SLN05, unless otherwise specified in SLN07.

856~279,4,This segment is used to specify the packaging of the item in the case or carton. There may be two levels of packaging specified. The first level is always specified by using PO401 (Pack). The first level may be actual items, e.g., consumer units, or it may be the number of smaller containers within the case. The second level, specified using PO414 (Inner Pack), is the number of eaches in each inner container when PO401 is the number of smaller containers within the case. See Section V (Pack/Inner Pack Usage) for usage examples.\r\n\r\nThis segment can be used also to specify the weight and/or volume (cube) for the item by using PO406 and PO407, and/or PO408 and PO409.

860~13,4,See Section V (ITD Terms Specification and Formulas) for usage examples.\r\n\r\nIn the transitional period for the retail industry, from paper to full automated EDI transactions, there may be a perceived need to send text data with the terms. Clearly the goal is to have the entire retail industry participating in EDI. Therefore, if text data is needed to be sent for terms, ITD12 will contain the free form text. If additional text is needed, additional ITD segments will be used.\r\n\r\nMany times, deferred terms are specified on the purchase order with only the knowledge that the terms are to be based on a date value which is not known, e.g., invoice or delivery date. What is known is the percentage or dollar amount of each deferred installment, and the number of days after the date the terms are based on, that each installment will be due. In these cases, ITD01 will contain code 04, indicating deferred or installment terms, and ITD02 will contain the appropriate terms date basis code (most typically code 2 for Delivery Date, code 3 for Invoice Date, or code 15 for Receipt of Goods Date). ITD07 will contain the number of days after the terms basis date that this installment is due. ITD10 or ITD11 will be used to indicate a dollar amount (ITD10) for that installment or the percent (ITD11) for that installment. Use one ITD segment for each installment. When specifying deferred terms and the exact terms basis date is known, e.g., invoice date, ITD09 should be used to specify the exact deferred or installment date.

860~24,4,This segment is used to specify every carrier in the routing sequence or a specific routing sequence that has been previously identified (usually from a routing guide). The segment can also be used to indicate estimated transit time in days. Only use TD501 if needed for clarity; this is not a requirement in most retail applications. When referring to a pre-established routing guide, use code 91 or 92 in TD502, and identify the routing sequence, from the routing guide, in TD503. To identify a specific private parcel service, TD502 will contain code 2, and TD503 will contain the corresponding SCAC. TD510 and TD511 are used to specify transit time.
860~24~11,0,Transit time is based on the ship date and time in the DTM segment.

860~83,4,POC03 is the current (net) amount on order before the quantity is applied. POC04 is the quantity to be subtracted or added based upon the code in POC02.\r\n\r\nThe multi-SKU case pack is used by retailers to order cases packed with specific items, each with a specific quantity. This is similar to the dynamic assortment, however the unit of measurement code in POC05 is different for each use. For dynamic assortments, POC05 will contain code AS. This identifies the item listed in the Product/Service IDs as an assortment and the contents of the assortment are listed in subsequent SLN segments. For assortments, at least one occurrence of the Product/Service ID Qualifier and the Product/Service ID are required to identify the assortment. This may be a U.P.C., a vendor assigned number, or a retailer assigned number. There is no implication of packaging for assortments; this is part of the trading partners' business practices. Assortments are primarily used as an ordering tool. For the multi-SKU case pack, POC05 will contain code CA, and there is no requirement to send a Product/Service ID in the POC segment. The use of code CA in POC05, and the presence of the SLN segments, informs the receiver to pack the cases with the SKUs and quantities in the SLN segments. The quantity in POC03 is the number of cases being ordered. Each SLN segment, that follows the POC segment, lists the Product ID, e.g., U.P.C., and the quantity of the SKU that is to be in the case. The total units in each case is the sum of the quantities in the SLN segment.\r\n\r\nWhen POC02 contains code PC, POC06 may be used to specify the new unit cost for the item, and the CTP segment immediately following may be used to specify the new price. The type of price is defined by CTP02.\r\n\r\nThe codes listed for POC08 apply to every occurrence of Data Element 235 in the POC segment.\r\n\r\nSee Section III for complete U.P.C. and EAN code definitions.
860~83~3,0,This is the current (net) amount on order before the change quantity (POC04) is applied.

860~93~4~1,0,See Section III for code list.
860~96,4,This segment is used to specify the packaging of the item in the case or carton. There may be two levels of packaging specified. The first level is always specified by using PO401 (Pack). The first level may be actual items, e.g., consumer units, or it may be the number of smaller containers within the case. The second level, specified using PO414 (Inner Pack), is the number of eaches in each inner container when PO401 is the number of smaller containers within the case. See Section V (Pack/Inner Pack Usage) for usage examples.\r\n\r\nThis segment can be used also to specify the weight and/or volume (cube) for the item by using PO406 and PO407, and/or PO408 and PO409.

860~99,4,There is one segment for each Allowance, Charge, Service, or Promotion being specified. If this segment appears in the header area of the transaction set, the data applies to the entire transaction set. If this segment appears in the detail area of the transaction set, the data applies only to that line item. The data specified in the header area is exclusive of the data specified in the detail area; it is not the sum of the data in the detail area, i.e., allowances or charges.\r\n\r\nSAC04 contains special service requirement codes and special processing codes. This code list is maintained by the VICS EDI SMC and is located in Section III of this guideline.
860~99~10,0,When SAC02 contains code D170, this data element is required and will contain the quantity of free goods. The unit of measure is in SAC09.\r\n\r\nSAC10 alone is used to indicate a specific quantity which could be a dollar amount, that is applicable to the service, promotion, allowance, or charge.
860~99~12~01~1~0,0,The allowance or charge amount will be adjudicated as a separate item, i.e., a debit/credit memo or a separate invoice. The amount will not be reflected in the invoice total amount.
860~99~12~02~1~0,0,The allowance or charge amount will be reflected in the total transaction amount, e.g., Total Invoice Amount = Merchandise Price + Charges - Allowances.
860~99~12~03~1~0,0,The vendor will issue a check directly to the customer of the retailer, or end consumer, for the allowance or charge amount. The amount is not reflected in the total invoice amount.

GS~3,3,A unique code to identify the receiver. This is usually the same as the code used in ISA08. It could be used to define sub organizations, e.g., companies of a corporation, departments, etc. The trading partners must agree on the codes.
GS~4,3,The date the group was created in the sender's system; submit date. Format is CCYYMMDD.
GS~5,3,The time the group was created in the sender's system; submit time. Format is HHMM; 24 hour clock.
GS~6,3,The number assigned by the sender must be unique within each trading partner. The trading partner at the group level is defined by the Application Receiver Code (GS03). The uniqueness must be maintained until such time that a Functional Acknowledgment is received for that group.
GS~8,3,This is the version/release/industry subset of the transaction sets within the group. This is not the same as the version number in ISA12.
IEA~1,3,The number of GS segments within the transmission.
IEA~2,3,This must be the same number as is in the ISA segment (ISA13) for the transmission.
ISA~10,3,The time the interchange was created in the sender's system; submit time. Format is HHMM; 24 hour clock.
ISA~11,3,\t^\tThe value identified for retail use.
ISA~12,3,This version number is for the envelope only. It is not the same as the version number in GS08.
ISA~13,3,The number is sequentially assigned, by the sender, starting with one within each trading partner. The trading partner at the interchange level is defined by the Interchange Receiver ID (ISA08). The control number is incremented by one for each interchange envelope sent to the trading partner. When the control number reaches 999999999 (maximum size), the next interchange envelope will have control number 000000001.
ISA~14,3,The retail industry is not using transmission acknowledgments. The transmission acknowledgment is not the same as the functional group acknowledgment.
ISA~15,3,The test indicator is valuable for start-up system tests. The indicator applies to the entire transmission.
ISA~16,3,\t<>>\tThe value identified for retail use.
ISA~2,3,Normally this field is blank.
ISA~3,3,Security Information is used only when using the UCS Communication Standard. Normally the value is 00.
ISA~4,3,Normally this field is blank. If ISA03 contains code 01, this field will contain a password that has been agreed to by the sender and receiver.
ISA~5,3,The Interchange ID Qualifier is used to define the code used, in ISA06, to identify the sender of the interchange.\r\n\r\nThe Uniform Code Council assigned EDI Communications ID (Comm ID) is the convention for the identification of the sender and receiver of the EDI transmission. All members should encourage their respective trading partners to obtain and use the UCC Comm ID.\r\n\r\nThe common means of identification of transportation carriers is the Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC). When sending to or receiving from a transportation carrier, the SCAC should be used to identify the carrier.
ISA~6,3,The identification code described by ISA05, left justified, blank filled.
ISA~7,3,The Interchange ID Qualifier is used to define the code used, in ISA08, to identify the receiver of the interchange.\r\n\r\nThe Uniform Code Council assigned EDI Communications ID (Comm ID) is the convention for the identification of the sender and receiver of the EDI transmission. All members should encourage their respective trading partners to obtain and use the UCC Comm ID.\r\n\r\nThe common means of identification of transportation carriers is the Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC). When sending to or receiving from a transportation carrier, the SCAC should be used to identify the carrier.
ISA~8,3,The identification code described by ISA07, left justified, blank filled.
ISA~9,3,The date the interchange was created in the sender's system; submit date. Format is YYMMDD.
