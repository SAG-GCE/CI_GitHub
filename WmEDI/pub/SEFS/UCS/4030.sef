810,3,The 810 Invoice transaction guidelines have been included in the UCS standards implementation guidelines in addition to the 880-Grocery Products Invoice in order to meet emerging business needs. Efforts are being made by several segments of the grocery industry to standardize their EDI usage and use UCS guidelines for EDI transactions. This includes the Alcohol Beverage industry, Convenience Stores and Food Service, many of which have already implemented the 810-Invoice. In addition, many UCS participants implement across industries and find it necessary to implement both the 810-Invoice and the 880-Grocery Products Invoice. The guidelines in the 810-Invoice have been aligned with the 880-Grocery Products Invoice to allow for easier implementation. The 880-Grocery Products Invoice continues to be the primary invoice transaction set used by the grocery industry, however consenting trading partners may now choose to utilize the 810-Invoice, particularly those trading primarily in the Alcohol Beverage, Food Service or Convenience Store segments. The following profiles can be used in conjunction with the UCS guidelines.

820~16,4,The purpose of this segment is to identify entities (e.g., divisions) within the sender. If any segments within the detail section are sent, ENT01 is required. This means that the presence of any detail area information must begin with an ENT segment, e.g., the ENT segment can be used as a place mark.\r\n\r\nReferencing the comments above, only the options explained in Comments B, C, and D are valid in UCS. These are the three valid groupings which relate to the sender only:\r\n\tSingle/Single\r\n\tSingle/Multiple\r\n\tMultiple/Single\r\n\r\nENT02 through ENT04 are used to identify the sender of the transaction.
820~16~1,0,ENT01 is used as a placeholder in the single/single relationship and requires no other ENT data elements.
820~16~2,0,ENT02 must contain code PR (Payer) when a multiple/multiple or multiple/single relationship exists.
820~19,4,This segment, in the detail area, further defines the entities with the payer, e.g., location numbers (store numbers). This segment is also used to identify the customer receiving the invoice on which the broker commission is based when this transaction set is used for payment of broker commissions.\r\n\r\nWhen this segment is used, at least one of NM103 or NM108 must be present.
820~25,4,This ADX segment should be used to specify details for adjustments reported in a separate document, e.g., Credit/Debit Adjustment Transaction Set (812) and for an item which is not referenced within the detail RMR loop in this transaction. Adjustments to previously paid invoices should be identified in this occurrence of the ADX.
820~25~2,0,When ADX02 contains the following codes, the adjustment is to the basis amount used for computation of the broker commission:\r\n\tGC\tMarket Development Fund Deduction\r\n\tGH\tBillback Allowance Deduction\r\n\tGJ\tUnsalable Payments Deduction\r\n\tGK\tSplit Commissions Deduction - Basis Amount\r\n\t54\tFreight Deducted\r\n\r\nWhen ADX02 contains the following codes the adjustment is to the net broker commission payable:\r\n\tGL\tUnresolved Customer Deduction\r\n\tGM\tSplit Commissions Deduction - Commission Amount

820~2~5,0,BPR05 is related to BPR04 as follows: If BPR04 contains code CHK, BPR05 should contain code PBC. If BPR04 contains code ACH, BPR05 should contain code CCD, CCP, CTP, CTX, PPD, or PPP. If BPR04 contains code BOP, FEW, or FWT, BPR05 should not be used.
820~31,4,The IT1 loop, within the ADX loop, is the adjustment line item detail loop. This segment identifies line items on the preceding ADX segment.\r\n\r\nIT101 represents adjustment line item identification when used within the adjustment loop. \r\nIT102 represents contested quantities e.g., items damaged, shorted, returned, and overages, when used within the adjustment loop.;\r\n\r\nFor Motor Fuel credit card processing and pre-draft notification, IT102 contians the number of credit card transactions in this line item.\r\n\r\nEffective with the UCS version coinciding with the UCC-published sunset date (2005) for the discontinuation of the use of 12-digit product identifiers, the qualifier UA (U.P.C./EAN Case Code (2-5-5) in DE235 will be marked as not used and will be replaced with the qualifier UK (U.P.C./EAN Shipping Container Code (1-2-5-5-1). The corresponding 14-digit product code will be reflected in DE234. This parallels the global transition to the 14-digit UCC/EAN-14 product identification numbering structure. In preparation for this transition, the UK qualifier and the corresponding 14-digit product code should be communicated in IT106 and IT107, respectively.\r\n\r\nFor Motor Fuel credit card processing and pre-draft notification, IT104 represents the total dollar amount for the number of credit card transactions contained in IT102.
820~31~6,0,The codes listed for IT106 apply to every occurrence of data element 235 in the IT1 segment.
820~36,4,SAC01 is not used to determine the positive or negative value of SAC05 or SAC08. All negative values must be signed.
820~36~13,0,SAC13 should contain the Manufacturer's Promotion ID number if the adjustment pertains to a promotion.
820~38~1,0,DTM01 should contain the "015" qualifier (Promotion Start Date) if the adjustment references the Manufacturer's Promotion ID Number in the SAC13 element within the SAC segment.
820~38~2,0,DTM02 should contain the Promotion Start Date when the "015" qualifier is used in the DTM01 element.
820~46~2,0,RMR02 contains the document number being paid, e.g., invoice number.
820~46~3,0,RMR03 contains code AI when this transaction set is used for payment of broker commissions.
820~46~4,0,RMR04 contains the amount being paid, inclusive of discounts and adjustments (not paid).\r\n\r\nRMR04 must be signed if negative, which means that it has reduced the BPR payment amount. If the value is positive, it has increased the BPR payment amount.\r\n\r\nRMR04 is required when this transaction set is used for payment of broker commissions.
820~46~5,0,RMR05 identifies the original or historic value of the document, e.g., the total invoice amount.
820~46~6,0,RMR06 should be positive if it involves a payment, negative if it involves a return or credit for a previously taken cash discount in a Direct Store Delivery (DSD) environment.\r\n\r\nRMR06 contains the total amount of deductions from the invoice amount in RMR05 when this transaction set is used for payment of broker commissions. The ADX segment within the RMR loop provides reasons for the deduction amounts.
820~48,4,This segment contains ancillary reference numbers, such as purchase order number or broker order number, which relate to the previous RMR segment. This segment is NOT intended to identify the primary document number (which should be in RMR01 and RMR02).
820~49,4,This is the date of the document specified in the previous RMR02. If the document date is being transmitted, it must be in the first occurrence of the DTM segment (in the header area).
820~4~1~1~1~0,0,Reference number assigned by the originator identifying this payment order
820~4~1~3~1~0,0,Control number used to tie dollars and remittance information (re-association)
820~4~2,0,TRN02 is the control number used to tie funds to the remittance, e.g., the check number.
820~51,4,Use this segment for evaluated receipts, partial payments or other circumstances, when absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nThe codes listed for IT106 apply to every occurrence of data element 235 in the IT1 segment.
820~6,4,If the original (referenced) transaction set supports a REF (or N9) segment, a common number could be used in that original transactions' REF (or N9) segment, REF02 (or N902), to link the transactions together. By using the same common number in multiple transactions, it then becomes possible to identify and refer to batches of transactions.
820~63,4,This adjustment loop can only contain adjustment information for a previous RMR segment and affects the amount (RMR04) calculation. Using this ADX segment precludes the usage of a Credit/Debit Adjustment Transaction Set (812) denoted within the outer ENT/ADX loop of this transaction set.\r\n\r\nWhen this transaction set is used for payment of broker commissions, this segment provides reasons for the deduction amount expressed in RMR06. If more than one reason applies, then multiple iterations of the ADX segment are required.
820~63~2,0,When ADX02 contains the following codes, the adjustment is to the basis amount used for computation of the broker commission:\r\n\tGC\tMarket Development Fund Deduction\r\n\tGH\tBillback Allowance Deduction\r\n\tGJ\tUnsalable Payments Deduction\r\n\tGK\tSplit Commissions Deduction - Basis Amount\r\n\t54\tFreight Deducted\r\n\r\nWhen ADX02 contains the following codes the adjustment is to the net broker commission payable:\r\n\tGL\tUnresolved Customer Deduction\r\n\tGM\tSplit Commissions Deduction - Commission Amount\r\n\r\nADX02 code values L7 and L8 should only be used when the available specific adjustment reason codes do not describe the type of deduction properly. When codes L7 and L8 are used, the NTE segment should contain a free-form description of the adjustment.;
820~64,4,This segment is used only for further description of preceding adjustments.
820~68,4,The IT1 loop within the ADX loop is the adjustment line item detail loop. This segment identifies line items on the preceding ADX segment.\r\n\r\nThe codes listed for IT106 apply to every occurrence of data element 235 in the IT1 segment.
820~7,4,This segment contains the date of the document referenced in the previous REF segment, e.g., the batch processing date. It may also contain dates associated with the broker commission statement, e.g., report period.
820~73,4,SAC01 is not used to determine the positive or negative value of SAC05 or SAC08. All negative values must be signed.
820~73~13,0,SAC13 should contain the Manufacturer's Promotion ID number if the adjustment pertains to a promotion.
820~75~1,0,DTM01 should contain the "015" qualifier (Promotion Start Date) if the adjustment references the Manufacturer's Promotion ID Number in the SAC13 element within the SAC segment.
820~75~2,0,DTM02 should contain the Promotion Start Date when the "015" qualifier is used in the DTM01 element.
820~7~1~234~1~0,0,Electronic funds transfer
820~7~1~582~1~0,0,Accounting period
820~8,4,This segment must be used twice, one iteration to designate payer and one iteration to designate the payee. This is the maximum usage. Name must be included in N102 when designating the payer.
824,3,Do not use Transaction Set 824 in place of Transaction Set 812 (Credit/Debit Adjustment) to communicate adjustments related to allowances or pricing.

824~13,4,For financial institutions, this segment allows the receiver to inform the sender of the status of dollar amounts.
824~14,4,For financial institutions, this segment allows the receiver to inform the sender of the status of payment item counts.
824~16,4,The TED loop should be generated for each error condition detected.\r\n\r\nThis segment is required except when OTI01 contains code GA or TA.\r\n\r\nThe majority of specific application edits will involve a single data element. In this situation, the generic error condition detected is specified in TED01, and the name of the data element in error is specified in TED02. For example, if the department number is invalid, TED01 would contain code 024 and TED02 would contain "Invalid Department Number". If however, the specific application edit involves more than one data element, this data element describes the error condition, and the applicable data elements. For example, if an application edit detected retail price was not greater than cost price, TED01 would contain code 012 and this data element would contain "Retail price is not greater than cost price". If more than 60 characters are required to describe the error condition, the first 60 characters appear in this data element, and the remaining error description characters appear in NTE02. For example, TED01 contains code 010, TED02 contains "Sum of SKU cost extension does not equal total invoice", and NTE02 contains "quantity".\r\n\r\nThe codes listed in TED02 may not be used in conjunction with any code other than 024 in TED01.

824~16~2,0,When TED01 contains code 024, TED02 must contain either an application error code or free-form text description of the application error.\r\n\r\nIn TED02, when more than 60 characters are required to describe the error condition, the first 60 characters appear in this data elment, and the remaining error description characters appear in NTE02. For example, TED01 contains code 010, TED02 contains "Sum of SKU cost extensions does not equal toal invoice", and NTE02 contains "quantity".\r\n\r\nTED02 Code Value(s):\r\n\t101\tEffective Date Too Early\r\n\t102\tImproper Placement of Labels\r\n\t103\tInvoice Number\r\n\t104\tItem Already Exists (Product/Service ID)\r\n\t105\tItem Marked For Delete (Product/service ID)\r\n\t106\tItem Not Authorized For Buyer Assigned Vendor Number\r\n\t107\tMissing Or Invalid Location\r\n\t108\tLocation Received Not On Order\r\n\t109\tNegative Value\r\n\t110\tMissing Pack Level (Marking Idetification Is Missing)\r\n\t111\tDuplicat Purchase Order Number\r\n\t112\tMissing Product Description 1\r\n\t113\tMissing Product Description 2\r\n\t114\tQualifier Or Code Not Mapped To Application\r\n\t115\tMissing Qualifier Or Code (For Application)\r\n\t116\tRetail Price Is Greater Than suggested Retail Price\r\n\t117\tSender Not Authorized To Submit Ship Notice Data For\r\n\t\tBuyer Assigned Vendor Number\r\n\t118\tSender Not Authorized To Submit Ship Notice Fot Item(s)\r\n\t119\tDuplicate Shipment Identification Number\r\n\t120\tShip-To Location Not Consistent With Purchase Order Ship-To\r\n\t121\tDuplicate SSCC\r\n\t122\tInvalid SSCC Range\r\n\t123\tInvalid SSCC Structure\r\n\t124\tMissing Tare Level (Marking Identification Is Missing\r\n\t125\tUnscannable Labels\r\n\t126\tIncorrect Label Format\r\n\t127\tImproper Placement Of Labels\r\n\t128\tMissing Labels On Shipping Container\r\n\t129\tCost Change Not Accepted\r\n\t130\tUCC-12 Change Not Allowed\r\n\t131\tZero Value\r\n\t132\tItem Marked For Delete\r\n\t133\tItem Not Found On Purchase Order\r\n\t134\tMissing Or Invalid Invoice Number\r\n\t135\tDuplicate Purchase Order Number\r\n\t136\tReceiving Location Not On Order\r\n\t137\tAllowance Errors\r\n\t138\tPurchase Order Closed Or Cancelled\r\n\t139\tMissing Or Invalid Vendor Pack Quantity\r\n\t140\tMissing Or Invalid Ship To Location
824~16~7,0,In TED07 numeric values are sent with a decimal point only when needed, e.g., $15.95 would be sent as "15.95", and $29.00 would be sent as "29". Percent values are sent with a decimal point only when needed, e.g., 10.5% is sent as "10.5", and 2% is sent as "2".
824~16~8,0,TED08 is used to specify the criteria used to determine that the value identified in TED07 is in error. Numeric values are sent with a decimal point only when needed, e.g., $15.95 would be sent as "15.95", and $29.00 would be sent as "29". Percent values are sent with a decimal point only when needed, e.g., 10.5% is sent as "10.5", and 2% is sent as "2".
824~17,4,This segment is only generated when an error description contains more than 60 characters of data. For example, if 95 characters are required to describe the error condition, the first 60 characters appear in TED02, and the remaining 35 characters are sent in NTE02.
824~17~1~GEN~1~0,0,Applies to entire document
824~18,4,This segment is used to provide the receiver of the transaction additional information about the error condition specified in the associated TED segment. This segment is not used to specify the data in error, but provides a "pointer" or clue to the error condition.
824~2~2,0,BGN02 is the sender's internal number used to identify this transaction set within the sender's application system.
824~2~3,0,BGN03 is the date the transaction set was generated in the sender's application system.
824~3,4,In some EDI implementations, it may be necessary to identify the sender and/or receiver of the transaction set within each transaction set. To identify the sender of the transaction set, N101 will contain code FR, N103 will contain code 93, and N104 will contain the actual identification number. To identify the receiver of the transaction set, N101 will contain code TO, N103 will contain code 94, and N104 will contain the actual identification number. These four codes may be used only in the combination listed above and may only be used to identify the sender and/or receiver of the transaction set.
824~3~4,0,N104 is the location code as defined by N103. The location code may be a formal number, e.g. DUNS, or it may be assigned by either the buyer or seller. The location refers to a store, warehouse, distribution center, plant, etc. Location codes are used to alleviate the need to send complete names and addresses.
824~8,4,This segment is used to identify the contact person, telephone and fax, for the purpose of additional information concerning the application errors listed within this transaction set.
824~8~3,0,PER03 Code values apply to every occurrence of data element 365.
824~9~10,0,OTI10 contains ST01 data contents from the original transaction set header generated by the sender. If the original document was not an EDI transaction, use the appropriate code that would have been in ST01, e.g. paper invoice would be 810.
824~9~2,0,OTI02 identifies error transaction set's key field. For example, Transaction Set 810's key field is invoice number and Transaction Set 850's key field is purchase order number.
824~9~2~FI~1~0,0,This code is used only if OTI01 contains code GA, GP, or GR. For Transaction Set 820, place the financial institution's trace number in OTI03.
824~9~2~TN~1~0,0,This code is used only when the actual business application identification number for the transaction cannot be identified using one of the other codes in IT102.
824~9~3,0,OTI03 is the identification of the transaction within the business application, or the financial institution's trace number.
824~9~4,0,OTI04 contains GS02 data contents from the original functional group generated by the sender.

830,3,This transaction set may be used to convey data to support analysis and forecasting systems or to support a receiver managed stock replenishment program. BFR04 (Schedule Type Qualifier) is used to distinguish the two uses. In both cases, the forecast dates describe when the goods are needed, as opposed to when the sales are expected. The forecast is by location, and, it is assumed that subsequent forecasts replace previous forecasts. When used to support a receiver managed replenishment, the sender authorizes the receiver to replenish based on the data contained within the forecast. This differs from the Product Activity Data Transaction Set (852) in that the actual analysis of the point of sales or warehouse withdrawal data is being performed by the sender and the forecast represents the output of that sales analysis process, i.e. the projected needs of the receiver. This is not the same as the Purchase Order Transaction Set (875) that represents a finite order quantity nor is it to be used as a direct replacement for that transaction set. The detail parameters and conditions for the replenishment process are agreed to by the trading partners.
830~2,4,It is assumed that subsequent forecasts replace previous forecasts.\r\n\r\nBFR06 and BFR07 must reflect the earliest/latest dates used in the detail start date (FST04) and the detail end date (FST05).
830~23,4,The SDQ segment specifies the retailer's reporting location. Therefore, code RL is not used in the N1 segment for the forecasting transaction set when the SDQ segment is used. N1 and SDQ are mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nLocation is trading partner defined, e.g., store, distribution center, region, etc.\r\n\r\nIn some EDI implementations, it may be necessary to identify the sender and/or receiver of the transaction set within each transaction set. To identify the sender of the transaction set, N101 will contain code FR. To identify the receiver of the transaction set, N101 will contain code TO.
830~24,4,Use only if address information for the referenced organization or company in the N1 segment can not be derived from the code in N104.
830~25,4,Use only if address information for the referenced organization or company in the N1 segment can not be derived from the code in N104.
830~26,4,Use only if address information for the referenced organization or company in the N1 segment can not be derived from the code in N104.
830~2~4,0,BFR04 is the forecast type qualifier.
830~2~6,0,BFR06 is the starting date of the forecast.
830~2~7,0,BFR07 is the ending date of the forecast.
830~2~8,0,BFR08 is the date the forecast is generated (run date).
830~3,4,This segment may only be used when FST02 contains code Q (Order Release Authorization).
830~32,4,There is one LIN segment for each SKU.\r\n\r\nForecasting may occur at SKU level.\r\n\r\nEffective with the UCS version coinciding with the UCC-published sunset date (2005) for the discontinuation of the use of 12-digit product identifiers, the qualifier UA (U.P.C./EAN Case Code (2-5-5) in DE235 will be marked as not used and will be replaced with the qualifier UK (U.P.C./EAN Shipping Container Code (1-2-5-5-1). The corresponding 14-digit product code will be reflected in DE234. This parallels the global transition to the 14-digit and UCC/EAN-14 product identification numbering structure. In preparation for this transition, the UK qualifier and the corresponding 14-digit product code should be communicated in LIN04 and LIN05, respectively.
830~33~3~RE~1~0,0,Average retail price
830~33~3~WE~1~0,0,Projected price that the retailer expects to pay
830~42~3~EA~1~0,0,Number of retail selling units
830~5,4,There must be one occurrence of this segment to specify the retailer's department, if the retailer has departments. Additional segments may be used to specify other reference numbers.

830~5~1~IT~1~0,0,Identification number assigned to the retailer, by the vendor, for use within the vendor's system
830~71,4,Code C in FST02 is a forecast with the buyer's authorization for the seller to commit to resources such as labor or material. It is imperative that negotiations defining firm financial commitment have previously occurred and are agreed to by both buyer and seller.\r\n\r\nDates sent in FST04 and FST05 must be tied to the BFR segment, e.g., they cannot exceed the range specified in BFR06 and BFR07.\r\n\r\nThe sum of all quantities in the SDQ segment(s), for a line item, must equal the forecast quantity in FST01.
830~71~2~Q~1~0,0,This code is only used when the receiver is performing replenishment based on forecast information.
830~71~4,0,FST04 is the start date of the flexible interval and the Forecast Horizon Start date for the item(s) identified in the line item detail.
830~71~5,0,FST05 is the end date of the flexible interval and the Forecast Horizon End date for the item(s) identified in the line item detail.
830~73,4,This segment is used to distribute the forecast quantity (FST01) to various locations. SDQ02 serves the same purpose as N103, and all occurrences of data element 67, in this segment, function as N104. The SDQ segment functions as the N1 segment, with N101 containing code RL, that is, the SDQ specifies only one location. The N1 segment, in the basic forecast, specifies only one location. The sum of all quantities in all SDQ segment(s), for a line item, must equal the forecast quantity in FST01.
830~80~1,0,CTT01 contains the number of LIN segments present in the transaction set.

846~16,4,If a suffix code applies to a U.P.C. Case Code Number, it is recommended that the Product/Service ID Qualifier immediately following contain code UC and the corresponding Product/Service ID contain the suffix.\r\n\r\nEffective with the UCS version coinciding with the UCC-published sunset date (2005) for the discontinuation of the use of 12-digit product identifiers, the qualifier UA (U.P.C./EAN Case Code (2-5-5) in DE235 will be marked as not used and will be replaced with the qualifier UK (U.P.C./EAN Shipping Container Code (1-2-5-5-1). The corresponding 14-digit product code will be reflected in DE234. This parallels the global transition to the 14-digit and UCC/EAN-14 product identification numbering structure. In preparation for this transition, the UK qualifier and the corresponding 14-digit product code should be communicated in LIN04 and LIN05, respectively.
846~23,4,SAC01 is not used to determine the positive or negative value of SAC05 or SAC08. All negative values must be signed.

850,3,The 850 Purchase Order transaction guidelines have been included in the UCS standards implementation guidelines in addition to the 875-Grocery Products Purchase Order in order to meet emerging business needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nEfforts are being made by several segments of the grocery industry to standardize their EDI usage and use UCS guidelines for EDI transactions. This includes the Alcohol Beverage industry, Convenience Stores and Food Service, many of which already implemented the 850-Purchase Order. In addition, many UCS participants implement across industries and find it necessary to implement both the 850-Purchase Order and the 875-Grocery Products Purchase Order to allow for easier implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 875-Grocery Products Purchase Order continues to be the primary purchase order transaction set used by the grocery industry, however consenting trading partners may now choose to utilize the 850-Purchase Order, particularly those trading primarily in the alcohol beverage, food service or convenience store segments.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following profile can be used in conjuction with the UCS guidelines. See Introduction for a definition of profiles and their usage:\r\n\tConvenience Store\r\n\tMotor Fuel

888,3,The maintenance types (G53 segment) and the products included, will be determined by previous agreement between the sender and receiver of the transaction set. For a new item setup, the Price Information Transaction Set (879) should accompany this transaction set to provide complete pricing information. Use the Promotion Announcement Transaction Set (889) for sending detailed promotion information. It is assumed that each Item Maintenance Transaction Set will be applied by the distributor in the order they are generated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee Section III, Standards and Conventions for information on describing modules.\r\n\r\nThe following profiles can be used in conjunction with the UCS guidelines. See Introduction for a definition of profiles and their usage:\r\n\tConvenience Store\r\n\tLottery

888~14~1~001~1~0,0,G3901 or G3902/G3903 will identify the item being changed. All previously sent data must be sent along with any changes that are to be communicated. All information provided is assumed to replace current information in the receiver's database. The G54 segment should not be sent. Changes to the contents of a module should be accomplished by deleting the old module code and adding a new one.
888~14~1~002~1~0,0,G3901 or G3902/G3903 will identify the item being deleted. Normally no other segments should be sent. However, when deleting a U.P.C. Case Code and the U.P.C. Consumer Package Code(s) associated with it, send the G55 segment indicating the U.P.C. Consumer Package Code(s) to be deleted. Do not send the G55 segment if the U.P.C. Consumer Package Code(s) are not to be deleted.
888~14~1~003~1~0,0,G3901 or G3902/G3903 will identify the new item. When this code is used, the Price Information Transaction Set (879) should accompany the Item Maintenance Transaction Set (888) to provide price information.
888~14~1~004~1~0,0,G3901 or G3902/G3903 will identify the item to be withdrawn or restored. No other segments should be sent. It is assumed that a distributor will retain item information until it is deleted (code 002).;
888~14~1~005~1~0,0,G3901 or G3902/G3903 will identify the item to be withdrawn or restored. No other segments should be sent. It is assumed that a distributor will retain item information until it is deleted (code 002).

888~18,4,The G39 segment is the primary identification of the vendors selling unit (case or pallet). G55 is the primary identification of the consumer selling unit. G39 is required unless the vendor sells/delivers product by consumer unit only (e.g. DSD vendor). In this case, the G39 is not used and the consumer selling unit is identified in the G55.\r\n\r\nEffective with the UCS version coinciding with the UCC-published sunset date (2005) for the discontinuation of the use of 12-digit product identifiers, G3901 (U.P.C. Case Code) will be marked as not used and will be replaced with the qualifier UK (U.P.C./EAN Shipping Container Code (1-2-5-5-1) in G3902. The corresponding 14-digit product code will be reflected in DE234. This parallels the global transition to the 14-digit UCC/EAN-14 product identification numbering structure. In preparation for this transition, the UK qualifier and the corresponding 14-digit product code should be communicated in G3902 and G3903, respectively.\r\n\r\nWhen the vendor's selling unit is a pallet or module, G3901 is not used and the pallet/module code is identified in G3903 using code UK in G3902. When the pallet/module consists of one or more cases of product, the G54 segment identifies the U.P.C. Case Code and quantities of each associated with the pallet/module. The G55 segment is not used in this 0310 loop. Additional iteration(s) of the 0310 loop may be sent to indicate the specifications of each case contained in the pallet in the G39 and the specifications of the consumer selling unit in the G55. When the pallet/module consists of individual consumer units which are not packed in cases, the individual consumer unit(s) would be identified in the G55 segment and the associated quantity in the QTY segment. Multiple occurrences of the G55 loop would be used if more than one product exists on a pallet/module.\r\n\r\nWhen a new item is added (G5301 contains code 003) and is a permanent replacement for an existing item, the new item is identified using G3901 or G3902/G3903 and the replaced item is identified in G3923 and G3924. The product being replaced should be deleted (G5301 contains code 002) using another iteration of the G53 loop within the same ST/SE.\r\n\r\nWhen a new item is added (G5301 contains code 003) and is a temporary substitution for an existing item, the new item is identified in G3901 or G3902/G3903 and the substituted item is identified in G3923/G3924.\r\n\r\nG3909, G3911, and G3913 must all be in the same unit of measure.\r\n\r\nG3918 and G3919 are only used when the vendor's shipping unit is the consumer unit.\r\n\r\nG3923 and G3924 are only used to indicate the replaced item (see Guideline above).\r\n\r\nSee Section IV, Standards Conventions, for information on describing pack and inner pack.
